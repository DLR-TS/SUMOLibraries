.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program builds a VRT (Virtual Dataset) that is a mosaic of the list of input GDAL datasets\&. The list of input GDAL datasets can be specified at the end of the command line, or put in a text file (one filename per line) for very long lists, or it can be a MapServer tileindex (see \fBgdaltindex\fP utility)\&. In the later case, all entries in the tile index will be added to the VRT\&.
.PP
With -separate, each files goes into a separate band in the VRT band\&. Otherwise, the files are considered as tiles of a larger mosaic and the VRT file has as many bands as one of the input files\&.
.PP
If one GDAL dataset is made of several subdatasets and has 0 raster bands, all the subdatasets will be added to the VRT rather than the dataset itself\&.
.PP
gdalbuildvrt does some amount of checks to assure that all files that will be put in the resulting VRT have similar characteristics : number of bands, projection, color interpretation\&.\&.\&. If not, files that do not match the common characteristics will be skipped\&. (This is only true in the default mode, and not when using the -separate option)
.PP
If there is some amount of spatial overlapping between files, the order of files appearing in the list of source matter: files that are listed at the end are the ones from which the content will be fetched\&. Note that nodata will be taken into account to potentially fetch data from less prioritary datasets, but currently, alpha channel is not taken into account to do alpha compositing (so a source with alpha=0 appearing on top of another source will override is content)\&. This might be changed in later versions\&.
.PP
This utility is somehow equivalent to the gdal_vrtmerge\&.py utility and is build by default in GDAL 1\&.6\&.1\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-tileindex\fP:\fP" 1c
Use the specified value as the tile index field, instead of the default value with is 'location'\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-resolution\fP {highest|lowest|average|user}:\fP" 1c
In case the resolution of all input files is not the same, the -resolution flag enables the user to control the way the output resolution is computed\&. 'average' is the default\&. 'highest' will pick the smallest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters\&. 'lowest' will pick the largest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters\&. 'average' will compute an average of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters\&. 'user' is new in GDAL 1\&.7\&.0 and must be used in combination with the -tr option to specify the target resolution\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-tr\fP xres yres :\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) set target resolution\&. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units\&. Both must be positive values\&. Specifying those values is of course incompatible with highest|lowest|average values for -resolution option\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-tap\fP:\fP" 1c
(GDAL >= 1\&.8\&.0) (target aligned pixels) align the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the -tr, such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-te\fP xmin ymin xmax ymax :\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) set georeferenced extents of VRT file\&. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units\&. If not specified, the extent of the VRT is the minimum bounding box of the set of source rasters\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-addalpha\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) Adds an alpha mask band to the VRT when the source raster have none\&. Mainly useful for RGB sources (or grey-level sources)\&. The alpha band is filled on-the-fly with the value 0 in areas without any source raster, and with value 255 in areas with source raster\&. The effect is that a RGBA viewer will render the areas without source rasters as transparent and areas with source rasters as opaque\&. This option is not compatible with -separate\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-hidenodata\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) Even if any band contains nodata value, giving this option makes the VRT band not report the NoData\&. Useful when you want to control the background color of the dataset\&. By using along with the -addalpha option, you can prepare a dataset which doesn't report nodata value but is transparent in areas with no data\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-srcnodata\fP \fIvalue [value\&.\&.\&.]\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) Set nodata values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band)\&. If more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them together as a single operating system argument\&. If the option is not specified, the intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets will be used (if they exist)\&. The value set by this option is written in the NODATA element of each ComplexSource element\&. Use a value of \fCNone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-b\fP \fIband\fP:\fP" 1c
(GDAL >= 1\&.10\&.0) Select an input \fIband\fP to be processed\&. Bands are numbered from 1\&. If input bands not set all bands will be added to vrt\&. Multiple \fB-b\fP switches may be used to select a set of input bands\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-sd\fP \fIsubdataset\fP\fP" 1c
(GDAL >= 1\&.10\&.0) If the input dataset contains several subdatasets use a subdataset with the specified number (starting from 1)\&. This is an alternative of giving the full subdataset name as an input\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-vrtnodata\fP \fIvalue [value\&.\&.\&.]\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) Set nodata values at the VRT band level (different values can be supplied for each band)\&. If more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them together as a single operating system argument\&. If the option is not specified, intrinsic nodata settings on the first dataset will be used (if they exist)\&. The value set by this option is written in the NoDataValue element of each VRTRasterBand element\&. Use a value of \fCNone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-separate\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) Place each input file into a separate band\&. In that case, only the first band of each dataset will be placed into a new band\&. Contrary to the default mode, it is not required that all bands have the same datatype\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-allow_projection_difference\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) When this option is specified, the utility will accept to make a VRT even if the input datasets have not the same projection\&. Note: this does not mean that they will be reprojected\&. Their projection will just be ignored\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-optim\fP {[AUTO]/VECTOR/RASTER}}:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 2\&.3) Force the algorithm used (results are identical)\&. The raster mode is used in most cases and optimise read/write operations\&. The vector mode is useful with a decent amount of input features and optimise the CPU use\&. That mode have to be used with tiled images to be efficient\&. The auto mode (the default) will chose the algorithm based on input and output properties\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-a_srs\fP \fIsrs_def\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.10) Override the projection for the output file\&. The \fIsrs_def\fP may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms, complete WKT, PROJ\&.4, EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT\&. No reprojection is done\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-r\fP \fI{nearest (default),bilinear,cubic,cubicspline,lanczos,average,mode}\fP:\fP" 1c
(GDAL >= 2\&.0) Select a resampling algorithm\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-oo\fP \fINAME=VALUE\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 2\&.2) Dataset open option (format specific)
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-input_file_list\fP:\fP" 1c
To specify a text file with an input filename on each line 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-q\fP:\fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 1\&.7\&.0) To disable the progress bar on the console 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-overwrite\fP:\fP" 1c
Overwrite the VRT if it already exists\&.
