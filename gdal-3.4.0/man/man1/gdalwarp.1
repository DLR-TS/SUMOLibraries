.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBgdalwarp\fP utility is an image mosaicing, reprojection and warping
utility. The program can reproject to any supported projection,
and can also apply GCPs stored with the image if the image is "raw"
with control information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s_srs <srs def>
Set source spatial reference. If not specified the SRS found in the input
dataset will be used.
.sp
The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything supported by the
OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG Projected,
Geographic or Compound CRS (i.e. EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition,
PROJ.4 declarations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.
.sp
Starting with GDAL 2.2, if the SRS has an explicit
vertical datum that points to a PROJ.4 geoidgrids, and the input dataset is a
single band dataset, a vertical correction will be applied to the values of the
dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s_coord_epoch <epoch>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the source SRS. Useful when the
source SRS is a dynamic CRS. Only taken into account if \fI\%\-s_srs\fP
is used.
.sp
Currently \fI\%\-s_coord_epoch\fP and \fI\%\-t_coord_epoch\fP are
mutually exclusive, due to lack of support for transformations between two dynamic CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t_srs <srs_def>
Set target spatial reference.
.sp
A source SRS must be available for reprojection to occur. The source SRS
will be by default the one found in the input dataset when it is available,
or as overridden by the user with \fI\%\-s_srs\fP
.sp
The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything supported by the
OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG Projected,

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t_coord_epoch <epoch>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the target SRS. Useful when the
target SRS is a dynamic CRS. Only taken into account if \fI\%\-t_srs\fP
is used.
.sp
Currently \fI\%\-s_coord_epoch\fP and \fI\%\-t_coord_epoch\fP are
mutually exclusive, due to lack of support for transformations between two dynamic CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ct <string>
A PROJ string (single step operation or multiple step string
starting with +proj=pipeline), a WKT2 string describing a CoordinateOperation,
or a \fI\%urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX\fP URN overriding the default
transformation from the source to the target CRS. It must take into account the
axis order of the source and target CRS.
.sp
New in version 3.0.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-to <NAME=VALUE>
Set a transformer option suitable to pass to \fBGDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer2()\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-vshift
Force the use of vertical shift. This option is generally not necessary,
except when using an explicit coordinate transformation (\fI\%\-ct\fP),
and not specifying an explicit source and target SRS.
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-novshift
Disable the use of vertical shift when one of the source or target SRS has
an explicit vertical datum, and the input dataset is a single band dataset.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
this option was named \fB\-novshiftgrid\fP in GDAL 2.2 to 3.3.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-order <n>
order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to select
a polynomial order based on the number of GCPs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tps
Force use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-rpc
Force use of RPCs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-geoloc
Force use of Geolocation Arrays.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-et <err_threshold>
Error threshold for transformation approximation (in pixel units \-
defaults to 0.125, unless, starting with GDAL 2.1, the RPC_DEM warping
option is specified, in which case, an exact transformer, i.e.
err_threshold=0, will be used).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-refine_gcps <tolerance minimum_gcps>
Refines the GCPs by automatically eliminating outliers.
Outliers will be eliminated until minimum_gcps are left or when no outliers can be detected.
The tolerance is passed to adjust when a GCP will be eliminated.
Not that GCP refinement only works with polynomial interpolation.
The tolerance is in pixel units if no projection is available, otherwise it is in SRS units.
If minimum_gcps is not provided, the minimum GCPs according to the polynomial model is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-te <xmin ymin xmax ymax>
Set georeferenced extents of output file to be created (in target SRS by
default, or in the SRS specified with \fI\%\-te_srs\fP)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-te_srs <srs_def>
Specifies the SRS in
which to interpret the coordinates given with \-te. The <srs_def> may
be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms, complete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file
containing the WKT.
This must not be confused with \-t_srs which is the target SRS of the output
dataset. \fI\%\-te_srs\fP is a convenience e.g. when knowing the output coordinates in a
geodetic long/lat SRS, but still wanting a result in a projected coordinate system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tr <xres> <yres>
Set output file resolution (in target georeferenced units).
.sp
If not specified (or not deduced from \-te and \-ts), gdalwarp will generate
an output raster with xres=yres, and that even when using gdalwarp in scenarios
not involving reprojection.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tap
(target aligned pixels) align the coordinates of the extent of the output
file to the values of the \fI\%\-tr\fP, such that the aligned extent
includes the minimum extent.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ts <width> <height>
Set output file size in pixels and lines. If width or height is set to 0,
the other dimension will be guessed from the computed resolution. Note that
\fI\%\-ts\fP cannot be used with \fI\%\-tr\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ovr <level|AUTO|AUTO\-n|NONE>
To specify which overview level of source files must be used. The default choice,
AUTO, will select the overview level whose resolution is the closest to the
target resolution. Specify an integer value (0\-based, i.e. 0=1st overview level)
to select a particular level. Specify AUTO\-n where n is an integer greater or
equal to 1, to select an overview level below the AUTO one. Or specify NONE to
force the base resolution to be used (can be useful if overviews have been
generated with a low quality resampling method, and the warping is done using a
higher quality resampling method).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-wo \(ga"NAME=VALUE"\(ga
Set a warp option.  The \fBGDALWarpOptions::papszWarpOptions\fP docs show all options.
Multiple \fI\%\-wo\fP options may be listed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ot <type>
Force the output image bands to have a specific data type supported by the
driver, which may be one of the following: \fBByte\fP, \fBUInt16\fP,
\fBInt16\fP, \fBUInt32\fP, \fBInt32\fP, \fBFloat32\fP, \fBFloat64\fP, \fBCInt16\fP,
\fBCInt32\fP, \fBCFloat32\fP or \fBCFloat64\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-wt <type>
Working pixel data type. The data type of pixels in the source image and
destination image buffers.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r <resampling_method>
Resampling method to use. Available methods are:
.sp
\fBnear\fP: nearest neighbour resampling (default, fastest algorithm, worst interpolation quality).
.sp
\fBbilinear\fP: bilinear resampling.
.sp
\fBcubic\fP: cubic resampling.
.sp
\fBcubicspline\fP: cubic spline resampling.
.sp
\fBlanczos\fP: Lanczos windowed sinc resampling.
.sp
\fBaverage\fP: average resampling, computes the weighted average of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBrms\fP root mean square / quadratic mean of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels (GDAL >= 3.3)
.sp
\fBmode\fP: mode resampling, selects the value which appears most often of all the sampled points.
.sp
\fBmax\fP: maximum resampling, selects the maximum value from all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBmin\fP: minimum resampling, selects the minimum value from all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBmed\fP: median resampling, selects the median value of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBq1\fP: first quartile resampling, selects the first quartile value of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBq3\fP: third quartile resampling, selects the third quartile value of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels.
.sp
\fBsum\fP: compute the weighted sum of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels (since GDAL 3.1)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-srcnodata <value [value...]>
Set nodata masking values for input bands (different values can be supplied
for each band). If more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted
to keep them together as a single operating system argument.
Masked values will not be used in interpolation.
Use a value of \fBNone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source dataset.
.sp
When this option is set to a non\-\fBNone\fP value, it causes the \fBUNIFIED_SRC_NODATA\fP
warping option (see \fBGDALWarpOptions::papszWarpOptions\fP) to be
set to \fBYES\fP, if it is not explicitly set.
.sp
If \fB\-srcnodata\fP is not explicitly set, but the source dataset has nodata values,
they will be taken into account, with \fBUNIFIED_SRC_NODATA\fP at \fBPARTIAL\fP
by default.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dstnodata <value [value...]>
Set nodata values
for output bands (different values can be supplied for each band).  If more
than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them together
as a single operating system argument.  New files will be initialized to this
value and if possible the nodata value will be recorded in the output
file. Use a value of \fBNone\fP to ensure that nodata is not defined.
If this argument is not used then nodata values will be copied from the source dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-srcalpha
Force the last band of a source image to be
considered as a source alpha band.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nosrcalpha
Prevent the alpha band of a source image to be
considered as such (it will be warped as a regular band)
.sp
New in version 2.2.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dstalpha
Create an output alpha band to identify nodata (unset/transparent) pixels.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-wm <memory_in_mb>
Set the amount of memory that the
warp API is allowed to use for caching. The value is interpreted as being
in megabytes if the value is less than 10000. For values >=10000, this is
interpreted as bytes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-multi
Use multithreaded warping implementation.
Two threads will be used to process chunks of image and perform
input/output operation simultaneously. Note that computation is not
multithreaded itself. To do that, you can use the \fI\%\-wo\fP NUM_THREADS=val/ALL_CPUS
option, which can be combined with \fI\%\-multi\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q
Be quiet.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-if <format>
Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It is generally
not necessary to specify it, but it can be used to skip automatic driver
detection, when it fails to select the appropriate driver.
This option can be repeated several times to specify several candidate drivers.
.sp
New in version 3.2.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-of <format>
Select the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the
format is guessed from the extension (previously was GTiff). Use the short
format name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-co <NAME=VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\-\-formats
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See raster_drivers format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-cutline <datasource>
Enable use of a blend cutline from the name OGR support datasource.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-cl <layername>
Select the named layer from the cutline datasource.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-cwhere <expression>
Restrict desired cutline features based on attribute query.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-csql <query>
Select cutline features using an SQL query instead of from a layer with \fI\%\-cl\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-cblend <distance>
Set a blend distance to use to blend over cutlines (in pixels).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-crop_to_cutline
Crop the extent of the target dataset to the extent of the cutline.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-overwrite
Overwrite the target dataset if it already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nomd
Do not copy metadata. Without this option, dataset and band metadata
(as well as some band information) will be copied from the first source dataset.
Items that differ between source datasets will be set to * (see \fI\%\-cvmd\fP option).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-cvmd <meta_conflict_value>
Value to set metadata items that conflict between source datasets
(default is "*"). Use "" to remove conflicting items.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-setci
Set the color interpretation of the bands of the target dataset from
the source dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-oo <NAME=VALUE>
Dataset open option (format specific)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-doo <NAME=VALUE>
Output dataset open option (format specific)
.sp
New in version 2.1.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <srcfile>
The source file name(s).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <dstfile>
The destination file name.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Mosaicing into an existing output file is supported if the output file
already exists. The spatial extent of the existing file will not
be modified to accommodate new data, so you may have to remove it in that case, or
use the \-overwrite option.
.sp
Polygon cutlines may be used as a mask to restrict the area of the
destination file that may be updated, including blending.  If the OGR
layer containing the cutline features has no explicit SRS, the cutline
features must be in the SRS of the destination file. When writing to a
not yet existing target dataset, its extent will be the one of the
original raster unless \-te or \-crop_to_cutline are specified.
.sp
Starting with GDAL 3.1, it is possible to use as output format a driver that
only supports the CreateCopy operation. This may internally imply creation of
a temporary file.
