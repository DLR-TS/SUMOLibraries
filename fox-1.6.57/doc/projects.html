<a href="http://www.tmpinc.com/tmp_vision_power.html">TMP Vision® and SLIM</a> were
designed to meet the demanding needs of engineers analyzing complex FEA models.<br>
For over 16 years, these tools and their predecessors have played an increasingly
important role in the visualization, interpretation and documentation of finite element
models.<br>
Today TMP Vision® and SLIM are a key part of the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics FEA
analysis process and have been used in the support of many aircraft programs
including the F-16, F-22, C-5 and Joint Strike Fighter. BAE Systems and Northrop
Grumman are also using these tools as a part of the JSF program.

draped onto terrain accurately (not stretched) no matter what size the
terrain is.</li>
<li>Completely cross platform.  From the GUI (thanks to FOX) to the
scenegraph workings, it should work on any platform out there.</li>
<li>Advanced Raster Support. Rasters can be drawn on in realtime or
re-used for other things.<li>
<li>Powerful WYSIWYG editing approach.  Almost everything is editable in
a nice user friendly way.</li>
<li>Procedural full detail buildings. No longer just a wall with a texture

application developed by <a href="http://www.cimplest.com">Cimplest Inc.</a> to support
Computer Aided Production Engineering (CAPE).
<br>
This application provides an easy to use graphical environment within which
a production engineer can rapidly develop models of manufacturing systems. The
following design and analysis activities are supported: materials requirements analysis,
work load analysis, optimal resource capacity allocation, dynamic lead time analysis,
production/part cost analysis, production scheduling, standard work design,
facilities layout design, process similarity analysis (group technology). Add-on
modules provide additional capabilities: the Performance Explorer module adds
Design of Experiments (DOE) capabilities for parameter sensitivity analysis;
the Performance Optimizer module adds Simulated Annealing (SA) based lead
time and production cost optimization capabilities; the ODBC Data Access module provides the
capability to create user defined scripts for accessing enterprise data sources; and
the WebDAV module provides the capability to publish and share Cimplest models in a
secure and distributed fashion.
<br>
The upcoming Apache web server module mod_cimplest will enable
Cimplest models developed within the workbench application to be updated with
data feeds from shop floor monitoring systems and will target real time scheduling
and supply chain integration efforts.</p>

This program is, as its name suggests, a diary that will be usable for years
to come. It displays one month at a time and includes the day name as well as
the date. You can add as many entries as you want to each day and you can select
the colour of the text and background for each entry. A diary entry can be
marked as an annual event, that is an event that occurs on the same date each year,
so that you need only enter such things as birthdays or anniversaries once.
You can print one month or a range of months.

<a href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/software">CLView</a> an assembly file viewer.<br>
This is a graphical, interactive tool for inspecting the ACE format assembly
files generated by CAP3 or phrap. Beasides the ACE files, the program also
supports a custom cluster layout format for the overview of a possible multiple
alignments generated just from pairwise alignments, where no detailed nucleotide
level alignment is needed and provided. The "containment clustering" program (nrcl)
mentioned in the TGI Clustering tools (TGICL) above can generate such a
"cluster layout" file (*.lyt). Here is a precompiled linux version with the
required dynamic FOX library included: clview_linux_i386.tar.gz
The program was built using the FOX toolkit by Jeroen van der Zijp,
a portable and feature-rich C++ framework for developing graphical user
interfaces under Unix and Windows. In order to compile the source code of this
viewer, you need to download the FOX library and the TGI C++ class library aims
to be a stable, open source, and graphical audio file editor primarily for but
not limited to the Linux operating system.
