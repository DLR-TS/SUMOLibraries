.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The gdallocationinfo utility provide a mechanism to query information about a pixel given its location in one of a variety of coordinate systems\&. Several reporting options are provided\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-xml\fP: \fP" 1c
The output report will be XML formatted for convenient post processing\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-lifonly\fP: \fP" 1c
The only output is filenames production from the LocationInfo request against the database (i\&.e\&. for identifying impacted file from VRT)\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-valonly\fP: \fP" 1c
The only output is the pixel values of the selected pixel on each of the selected bands\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-b\fP \fIband\fP: \fP" 1c
Selects a band to query\&. Multiple bands can be listed\&. By default all bands are queried\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-overview\fP \fIoverview_level\fP: \fP" 1c
Query the (overview_level)th overview (overview_level=1 is the 1st overview), instead of the base band\&. Note that the x,y location (if the coordinate system is pixel/line) must still be given with respect to the base band\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-l_srs\fP \fIsrs def\fP: \fP" 1c
The coordinate system of the input x, y location\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-geoloc\fP: \fP" 1c
Indicates input x,y points are in the georeferencing system of the image\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-wgs84\fP: \fP" 1c
Indicates input x,y points are WGS84 long, lat\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-oo\fP \fINAME=VALUE\fP: \fP" 1c
(starting with GDAL 2\&.0) Dataset open option (format specific)
.PP
.IP "\fB\fIsrcfile\fP:\fP" 1c
The source GDAL raster datasource name\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fIx\fP:\fP" 1c
X location of target pixel\&. By default the coordinate system is pixel/line unless -l_srs, -wgs84 or -geoloc supplied\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB\fIy\fP:\fP" 1c
Y location of target pixel\&. By default the coordinate system is pixel/line unless -l_srs, -wgs84 or -geoloc supplied\&.

.PP
This utility is intended to provide a variety of information about a pixel\&. Currently it reports three things:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP "\(bu" 2
The location of the pixel in pixel/line space\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The result of a LocationInfo metadata query against the datasource - currently this is only implemented for VRT files which will report the file(s) used to satisfy requests for that pixel\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The raster pixel value of that pixel for all or a subset of the bands\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The unscaled pixel value if a Scale and/or Offset apply to the band\&. 
.PP
.PP
The pixel selected is requested by x/y coordinate on the command line, or read from stdin\&. More than one coordinate pair can be supplied when reading coordinates from stdin\&. By default pixel/line coordinates are expected\&. However with use of the -geoloc, -wgs84, or -l_srs switches it is possible to specify the location in other coordinate systems\&.
.PP
The default report is in a human readable text format\&. It is possible to instead request xml output with the -xml switch\&.
.PP
For scripting purposes, the -valonly and -lifonly switches are provided to restrict output to the actual pixel values, or the LocationInfo files identified for the pixel\&.
.PP
It is anticipated that additional reporting capabilities will be added to gdallocationinfo in the future\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Simple example reporting on pixel (256,256) on the file utm\&.tif\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ gdallocationinfo utm.tif 256 256
Report:
  Location: (256P,256L)
  Band 1:
    Value: 115
.fi
.PP
.PP
Query a VRT file providing the location in WGS84, and getting the result in xml\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ gdallocationinfo -xml -wgs84 utm.vrt -117.5 33.75
<Report pixel="217" line="282">
  <BandReport band="1">
    <LocationInfo>
      <File>utm.tif</File>
    </LocationInfo>
    <Value>16</Value>
