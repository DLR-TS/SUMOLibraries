                      HDF Group Release notes for ZLIB 1.2.8
                          Aug 3, 2015

HDF changes:
   -- Remove files not used by HDF distribution

   -- CMake support added (CMakeLists.txt, and config/cmake folder), which allows for shared and/or static builds.
      No files were altered, except the zlib library name drops the '1'.

User support:
    Report all problems with this distribution to help@hdfgroup.org.
