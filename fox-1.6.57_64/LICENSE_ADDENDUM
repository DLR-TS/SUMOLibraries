FOX Toolkit Library License Addendum.


1. License.  The FOX Toolkit Library ("The Library") is licensed under GNU
Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

2. Relinking Exemption.  You may distribute a combined work using a
statically linked, unmodified copy of the FOX Library under terms of your
choice, without the relinking requirement stipulated under the GNU Lesser
Public License, subject to the following conditions:

  a. This static relinking exemption covers only the FOX Toolkit Library.
  Other libraries which the FOX Library may need are covered by their own
  respective licenses.

  b. Modification of the configure scripts, makefiles, or installation
  tools of the FOX Library to support a specific platform does not
  constitute creating a modified copy based on the FOX Library.

  c. Programs or binaries statically linked with the FOX Library must be
  identified as such by including, in the Documentation or by other means
  (for example in the About Box or Online Help), the following statement:

  "This software uses the FOX Toolkit Library (http://www.fox-toolkit.org)."

  d. Subclassing from Objects or Widgets supplied by the Library involves
  no modifications to the source code of the Library itself, and does not
  constitute creating a modified copy based on the Library.

3. If you do not accept or are unable to meet the conditions under (2), you
may continue to distribute the combined work under the original GNU Lesser
General Public License.


                             END OF ADDENDUM
