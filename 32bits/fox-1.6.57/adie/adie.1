.SH NAME
adie \- The ADvanced Interactive Editor
.SH INTRODUCTION
Adie is an extremely fast and convenient programming text editor written using the FOX Toolkit.
Besides being a nice text editor, Adie is also an extremely convenient file viewer,
supporting a plethora of methods to move from one file to the next.

For each visited file, Adie remembers where in that file you were last looking, and
which special places in that file have been bookmarked, so you can quickly return to frequently
visited places.

Project browsing is made easy by optionally displaying a File/Directory browser side by side
with the text so files may be visited by means of a single click.  Files may also be opened
simply by highlighting a file name, compiler warning message, or #include directive and hitting
a single button; Adie will search for the file in the same directory as an already
loaded file, or in a number of predefined directories (like for example include directories).
