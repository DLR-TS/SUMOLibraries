  <p>Icons and Images are part an parcel of attractive, user-friendly
Graphical User Interfaces these days.&nbsp; Consequently, considerable
effort has been expended in designing FOX to allow icon- and image-rich
applications to be developed with the greatest ease.<br>
In FOX, Images and Icons are objects that represent picture data.&nbsp;
Images are simple pictures, whereas Icons are pictures with a <i>shape
mask</i> that may be used to effectively mask out a certain area of the
picture, and allow part the background to peek through as if the
picture were transparent in some areas.<br>
Both Icons and Images may have <b>Client</b> <b>side</b> <b><i>pixel
data</i></b> as well as an <b>X Server side</b> <b><i>pixmap</i></b>
representation.&nbsp; The typical application will construct the
client-side pixel data by filling the Icon or Image with a picture,
then create the server-side representation [after contact with the X
Server has been established] by calling i<tt>con-&gt;create()</tt>,
which creates an server side <i>pixmap</i> and uses a call to&nbsp; <tt>icon-&gt;render()</tt>
to fill the pixmap with the pixel data .</p>
  <p>Note that this is a two-step process which is very similar to that
of constructing and creating regular FOX Widgets.&nbsp; This is no
accident.&nbsp; The FOX philosophy is to construct [client-side] data
structures such as Widgets and Icons and Images etc., then with all the
information available, create their X Server side representation in one
fell swoop by calling <tt>app-&gt;create()</tt>.</p>
  <p>When you have given Buttons or Labels or other FOX Widgets icons,
a call to that Widget's <tt>create()</tt> member function will also
automatically call its icon <tt>create()</tt>.&nbsp; To allow icons to
be shared by multiple Widgets, it is specifically allowed to call <tt>create()</tt>
more than once on an icon or image.</p>
  <p>In many cases, after calling an icon's create() member function,
there is no need to keep the client-side pixel data around; thus, FOX
icons will in most cases release the memory taken up by the pixel
data.&nbsp; Should you want to repeatedly change the pixel data,
however, FXIcon and FXImage have an option <b>IMAGE_KEEP</b> to allow
you to hang on to the pixel data in the client.&nbsp; After making
changes to the pixel data, you can call <tt>icon-&gt;render()</tt>
again to render it into the pixmap.</p>

  <b>ICO, </b><b>IFF, </b><b>JPEG</b>, <b>PCX, PNG</b>, <b>PPM,

compact than <span style="font-weight: bold;">XPM,</span> and about 2
times more compact than BMP.&nbsp; This is of some concern, as
applications may have lots of icons [some analysis of our own
applications revealed than one application's executable had about 1MB
worth of XPM icons; with GIF, this would have been less than a 100kB].</p>

<p>One crucial problem with icon-rich applications is where to keep
all those icons; obviously, keeping icons in separate files allows
end-users to substitute icons and perhaps change them with an Icon
Editor program.&nbsp; However, such a scenario also poses a
maintainance problem:- software becomes extraordinarily dependent on
specifics of a user installation, and end-users may actually break
software by substituting corrupted icon files by accident, or perhaps
other applications may overwrite them.&nbsp; Another common problem is
the need for end-users to set paths and environment variables.</p>
  <p>To eliminate these problems, the FOX approach is to <b><i>embed</i></b>
all icons and images right into the application's executable.&nbsp;
This is done by simply by compiling the icons into the code in the form
of C++ data statements, and then linking them in.</p>

<p>XPM and XBM icons or images can be directly included into the
source code, as these formats are basically just C++ data arrays
already and therefore no additional tools are required to embed them
into your source code.<br>

XPM is particularly convenient as it allows you to build icons even
without a graphical icon editor. Other image formats need to be
transformed into a C++ data array with a small build-time utility
called <a name="RESWRAP"></a><b><i>reswrap</i></b>, which is provided
in the FOX distribution.</p>

<p><b><i>Reswrap</i></b> allows you to generate the C or C++ data arrays
automatically from the icons during the build process of your application;
simply add a few rules into your Makefile, or, under VC++, use the reswrap
program in a so-called <em>Utility Project</em>.<br>

For example, given as input a GIF file image such as below:</p>
<p></p>
<center><img src="art/bigpenguin.png" height="57" width="48"><br>
Figure 1. Linux Penguin from file <i>bigpenguin.gif</i>.</center>
<p></p>

<p>After processing this file, reswrap generates a C data statement such as:</p>

<pre>
/* Generated by reswrap from file <i>bigpenguin.gif</i> */
const unsigned char bigpenguin[]={
  0x47,0x49,0x46,0x38,0x37,0x61,0x30,0x00,0x39,0x00,0xf3,0x00,0x00,0xb2,0xc0,0xdc,
  ...............................................................................
  ...............................................................................
  0xf4,0xe0,0x63,0x90,0x7c,0x7d,0x40,0xc5,0x92,0x0c,0x34,0x39,0x41,0x04,0x00,0x3b
};
</pre>

<p>This can then be subsequently compiled into an object file, and linked
in with the executable.&nbsp; To make use of such an icon, FOX supports
deserialization from a <i>memory stream</i>. The icon data above could
be used as follows to create an Icon:</p>
  <pre>FXIcon *tux_icon = new FXGIFIcon(application,bigpenguin);<br></pre>
  <p>Wait! Is that all? Yes it is!&nbsp; This <i>one</i> statement
creates
an icon object, then <i>deserializes</i> the icon data from the GIF
stream
to build the icon's internal pixel data.&nbsp; A subsequent call:</p>
  <pre>tux_icon-&gt;create();</pre>
  <p>Will create an X pixmap, render the icon into it, and subsequently
release
the pixel data after it is no longer needed.&nbsp; If you had created
the
icon with the IMAGE_KEEP option, the pixel data would have been kept
around
for subsequent manipulation by your application, and perhaps repeated
rendering.
To draw the icon in a window, simply:</p>
  <pre>dc.drawIcon(tux_icon,x,y);<br></pre>
  <p>will do the job.</p>

<ul>
  <p>Bitmaps (XBM images) in FOX behave very much like images.&nbsp;
Except, unlike Images which are always 24 bits, and in color, Bitmaps
are only one bit, or blank and white.&nbsp; Typical uses for Bitmaps
are the creation of patterns and stipples, or shape masks against which
other primitives are clipped. <br>
In terms of constructing and using Bitmaps in FOX, it is completely
analoguous:</p>
  <pre>
// Bitmap Data, in XBM Format

#define gray_width 32
#define gray_height 2
static unsigned char gray_bits[] = {0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa};

// Construct a bitmap object
FXBitmap *grayBitmap=new FXBitmap(application, gray_bits, 0, gray_width, gray_height);
  </pre>
  <p>In terms of using Bitmaps for subsequent tiling and stippling
operations,
remember that MS-Windows has certain size limits such patterns;&nbsp;
X-Windows
has no such limit, but presumably smaller patterns are more
efficient.&nbsp;
It is probably a good idea to keep so widths such as 8,16, or 32.</p>

<p>Cursors can be constructed in FOX to change the shape of the
mouse-cursor. Constructing Cursors is very similar to constructing Bitmaps, except
that Cursors comprise two bitmaps, a picture and a shape mask; also, Cursors
have a so-called hot-spot, the point inside the cursor-glyph which is
"pointer to" by the mouse. <br>
FOX currently also supports color cursors with an alpha component, i.e.
partially transparent cursors.
This is limited to certain platforms; on platforms where color cursors are not
supported, the color image is thresholded to a simple black/white image with the alpha
channel mapping to fully transparent.
Designing your color cursors with contrasting colors ensures that they will look
reasonable on such platforms.<br></p>

<p>Besides defining your own "custom" cursors, FOX also allows you to
simply create a "stock" cursor, i.e. a cursor whose shape has already
been predefined by the system.
To create a custom Cursor:</p>

<pre>
// Picture bits, in XBM Format<br>#define resize_width 32
#define resize_height 32
#define resize_x_hot 9
#define resize_y_hot 9
static unsigned char resize_bits[] = {
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xfc, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  ....
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};

// Shape bits, in XBM Format
#define resize_mask_width 32
#define resize_mask_height 32
#define resize_mask_x_hot 9
#define resize_mask_y_hot 9
static unsigned char resize_mask_bits[] = {
   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xfe, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0xfe, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00,
   ....
   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};

// Resize corner
resizeCursor=new FXCursor(application,resize_bits,resize_mask_bits,resize_width,resize_height,resize_x_hot,resize_y_hot);
</pre>

<p>To create a stock Cursor:</p>
<pre>
// Text Cursor<br>IBeamCursor=new FXCursor(application,CURSOR_IBEAM);
</pre>
<p>If you define your own Custom Cursors, make sure the size is exactly
32x32. MS-Windows does not support any other sizes.&nbsp; Also, the shape
and the picture will have to be the same size.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your icons may look funny. This is usually because FOX Icon
routines determine the wrong value for the transparency color.
FOX can handle images with a true alpha-channel, or images with a special
transparency color.

The latter is the more common approach, as many file formats do not support
true alpha channels. <br>

Different image formats guess the transparency color in different ways.
For <b><i>GIF</i></b> Images, FOX uses the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a transparent color is found in the GIF file, that color is used.</li>
  <li>If not, the background color is used.</li>
  <li>If the option IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR is used when constructing the icon, the specified color is used.</li>
  <li>Finally, if the option IMAGE_OPAQUE is used, the icon is forced to be non-transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For <b><i>BMP</i></b> images, there is no background or transparency
color in the image file format; the algorithm is simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assumed transparency color is the same as the default GUI background color,
which is FXRGB(192,192,192).</li>
<li>If the option IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR is used when constructing the icon,
the specified color is used.</li>
<li>Finally, if the option IMAGE_OPAQUE is used, the icon is forced to be
non-transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases, you will create your icons simply as below:</p>
<pre>
new FXGIFIcon(app,picture_data);
</pre>

<p>In some cases, you may want to override the transparency color with some
specific color:</p>
<pre>
new FXGIFIcon(app,picture_data,FXRGB(192,192,192),IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR);
</pre>

<p>The IMAGE_ALPHAGUESS option works very much like IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR, except that
instead of explicitly passing a color, you can let the system pick it for you.
The IMAGE_ALPHAGUESS looks at the corners of the image, picks the color which
is used the most often.  Since the edges around the icon picture are usually filled
with background color, this usually works very well (just remember to use a
background color which doesn't also appear inside the icon picture!).
This is used as follows:</p>
<pre>
new FXGIFIcon(app,picture_data,0,IMAGE_ALPHAGUESS);
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can force an image to be rendered with no transparency at all, by passing
the IMAGE_OPAQUE option:</p>
<pre>
new FXGIFIcon(app,picture_data,0,IMAGE_OPQUE);
</pre>

<p>The reswrap tool has a number of options to make it convenient to
build C++ source and header files automatically from image files as a part of
your regular project build process.

Reswrap is normally invoked as follows:</p>

<pre>
NAME
       reswrap - wrap icon resources into C or C++ code

SYNOPSIS
       reswrap [options] [-o[a] outfile] files...

DESCRIPTION
       Reswrap is a tool to turn images, text, and other resource files into C
       or C++ data arrays.  This allows various binary resources to be  embed-
       ded in the source code, and compiled into an application.

       In  development of graphical applications with FOX, it is used to embed
       icons and images for the user interface into the executable and  elimi-
       nate the need to distribute separate icon and image files.

       Reswrap is typically invoked as a part of the build process to generate
       C++ source files from a collection of icons and images and other binary
       resources.

       By  default  reswrap will interpret the files listed as a stream of raw
       bytes and output them as an initialized data array to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              Print summary usage information of all the supported options.


       -v, --version
              Print the version number and license information.


       -h, --header
              Generate an output file containing  only  declarations  suitable
              for including as a header file.  This also enables the  --extern
              option automatically.


       -s, --source
              Generate an output file containing  data  arrays.   This  option
              disables  the  --extern option.  This option is the default when
              no directives are given.

       -i file, --include file
              Generate a #include "file" directive in the output file, to make
              the  declarations available when compiling the data source file.


       -o file, --output file
              Write the output of the conversion into file instead of  writing
              to stdout.

       -oa file, --append file
              Append  the  output of the conversion to file instead of writing
              to stdout.


       -e, --extern
              Places the storage modifier extern in front of the  data  array,
              ensuring   that   the  data  array  can  be  linked  with  other
              compilation units.  Normally, constant declarations are not vis-
              ible  in  other compilation units.  This option is automatically
              turned on when --header is passed.


       -S, --static
              Places the storage modifier static in front of the  data  array.
              This makes the symbols invisible outside the compilation unit.


       -z, --size
              Output  the  size  of  the  resource  in  the  declaration  of a
              resource-array.  This allows the sizeof() operator to return the
              correct  size  of  the  resource even for external declarations.
              Note that in text mode, (--text or --ascii  options),  an  extra
              byte is added to the size for the end of string character.

       -d, --decimal
              Write  data as decimal numbers instead of using the default hex-
              adecimal numbers.


       -x, --hex
              Write data as hexadecimal numbers. This option is the default.


       -t, --text
              Write data as a text string, with each  byte  represented  as  a
              hexadecimal  excape  sequence,  as  in "\x33".  The C++ compiler
              appends a nul-character at the end of the text string, thus mak-
              ing  the data array one character longer than the resource file.


       -ta, --ascii
              Write data as a text string, with each  byte  represented  as  a
              hexadecimal  excape  sequence,  as  in "\x33".  The C++ compiler
              appends a nul-character at the end of the text string, thus mak-
              ing  the data array one character longer than the resource file.

              With the --ascii option, printable ascii characters  are  passed
              unescaped,  while  special characters like tabs and newlines are
              given the usual escape codes.

       -k, --keep-ext
              This option causes reswrap to keep the file extension, replacing
              the  "."  with an underscore "_".  For example, image.gif gener-
              ates const unsigned char image_gif[].

              This option is recommended as it reduces errors when  using  the
              data arrays.


       -nk, --drop-ext
              This option causes the declaration to be based only on the base-
              name of the resource file.   For  example,  image.gif  generates
              const unsigned char image[].


       -m, --msdos
              Read  files  with  MS-DOS  mode.  This replaces "\r\n" with "\n"
              when reading the resource file.


       -b, --binary
              Read files in BINARY mode. This option is the default.


       -u, --unsigned
              Generate nsigned char declaration, even when  --text or  --ascii
              was specified.


       -p name, --prefix name
              Prepend  the  given prefix in front of the name of the resource;
              this may be used to generate class names or namespace  names  in
              front of symbols.

       -f name, --suffix name
              Prepend  the  given prefix in front of the name of the resource;
              this may be used to generate class names or namespace  names  in
              front of symbols.


       -n name, --namespace name
              Generate  all declarations inside the given C++ namespace decla-
              ration.  Using a namespace may be used to ensure  that  declara-
              tions are only accessible within the given scope, and thus won't
              clash with symbols.


       -c cols, --columns cols
              Writes cols columns instead of the default number of columns  in
              the data statements generated by reswrap.  The default number of
              columns for decimal and  hex  printout  is  16  characters;  the
              default for text string printout is 80 characters.


       -r name, --resource name
              Instead  of using a resource name based on the filename, reswrap
              substitutes name for the resource name used in  the  declaration
              or  definition  for the following resource file.  This is useful
              if the filename can not be used as an identifier, for example if
              the  filename  happens  to  be a reserved word in C or C++, like
              "while.gif".
</pre>

Example of using reswrap in your Application's Makefile:
<p></p>
<pre>
OBJECTS = icons.o myapp.o

ICONS = bigpenguin.gif logo.gif fileopen.gif

# Generate header file containing declarations
icons.h: $(ICONS)
        reswrap -h -o icons.h $(ICONS)

# Generate source file containing data arrays
# The "-i icons.h " parameter writes an #include directive
# into the output file.
icons.cpp: $(ICONS) icons.h
        reswrap -i icons.h -o icons.cpp $(ICONS)

# Link it all together
myapp: $(OBJECTS)
        gcc -o myapp $(OBJECTS) -lFOX -lm -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11

myapp.o: myapp.cpp icons.h

</pre>
<p>This will cause make to generate two files, <tt>icons.h</tt> and <tt>icons.cpp</tt>
which contain the declarations and definitions respectively for all the
reswrapped icons listed in the $(ICONS) variable.  <br>
The <tt>icons.cpp</tt> will include the icon.h header file so as to inform the
compiler of the declarations.
</p>
With the latest version of reswrap, you can even do both in one single step:
<pre>
reswrap --header -o icons.h $(ICONS) --source --include icons.h -o icons.cpp $(ICONS)
</pre>
We also used the new long options here.
</ul>
