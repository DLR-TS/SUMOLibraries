FOX basically follows the standard GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
Because of repeated questions on this topic, it has become apparent that many
people still had a number of uncertainties about licensing issues.
<p>
Also, a number of stipulations in the GNU Lesser Public License statement have
evidently been an impediment to truely wide-spread adoption of the FOX Library.
<p>
Thus, the intent of the License Addendum has been to provide clarification
of a number of obscure issues in the GNU Lesser General Public License, and to
relax a few of its stipulations with an eye to solving a couple of practical issues.
<p>
Below follows the GNU Lesser Public License, followed by the FOX Library License
addendum.
<p>
Finally, detailed rationale behind the License Addendum is presented.
<p>
<pre>
		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

FOX Toolkit Library License Addendum.


1. License.  The FOX Toolkit Library ("The Library") is licensed under GNU
Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

2. Relinking Exemption.  You may distribute a combined work using a
statically linked, unmodified copy of the FOX Library under terms of your
choice, without the relinking requirement stipulated under the GNU Lesser
Public License, subject to the following conditions:

  a. This static relinking exemption covers only the FOX Toolkit Library.
  Other libraries which the FOX Library may need are covered by their own
  respective licenses.

  b. Modification of the configure scripts, makefiles, or installation
  tools of the FOX Library to support a specific platform does not
  constitute creating a modified copy based on the FOX Library.

  c. Programs or binaries statically linked with the FOX Library must be
  identified as such by including, in the Documentation or by other means
  (for example in the About Box or Online Help), the following statement:

  "This software uses the FOX Toolkit Library (http://www.fox-toolkit.org)."

  d. Subclassing from Objects or Widgets supplied by the Library involves
  no modifications to the source code of the Library itself, and does not
  constitute creating a modified copy based on the Library.

3. This FOX Toolkit Library License Addendum is NOT propagated to derivative
works.  When making derivative works based on the FOX Library, this license
addendum ceases to apply, and code will revert to the simple GNU Lesser General
Public License.  The Relinking Exemption only applies to unmodified versions
of the FOX Library.

4. If you do not accept or are unable to meet the conditions under (2), you
may continue to distribute the combined work under the original GNU Lesser
General Public License.


                             END OF ADDENDUM

<p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
We now launch into a point by point discussion of the License Addendum:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Point 1.</b> says that basically, FOX follows the GNU Lesser General Public License.</li>

<p>
<li><b>Point 2.</b> addresses the practical problem of static linking FOX into
an application program or <em>combined work</em>.
The GNU Lesser General Public License insists that the recipient of a distribution of a
<em>combined work</em> i.e. a program linked with the Library, be allowed to relink.
<p>
Linking a program dynamically is usually the easiest way to comply with this stipulation.
However, there are sometimes practical or logistical problems which make it difficult
to comply with this requirement.
<p>
We have taken the position that static linking is functionally equivalent to dynamic
linking, and we're not really denying the recipient of a statically linked program
any source code he or she wouldn't be able to obtain otherwise, as long as the
program is linked with an <em>unmodified copy</em> of the Library.
<p>
Static linking with a <em>modified copy</em> of the Library, however, would deny
the community the benefit of these modifications, as these modifications would now
be locked up inside a closed binary executable, so therefore we must insist on the
original GNU Lesser General Public License when the Library has been modified.</li>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Item a.</b> says we can not make any statements about anyone else's
code; if your application must use other libraries (jpeg, png, tiff, glibc, and so
on), then you must observe the licenses of these other libraries.</li>

<p>
<li><b>Item b.</b> clarifies that when we're talking about <em>derived works</em>,
we're not talking about making some minor changes to Makefiles or configuration scripts
which are often needed to make the code compile on a particular platform or compiler.</li>

<p>
<li><b>Item c.</b> requires you to identify your program as using the FOX library.
With static linking, there would be no way for a normal user to tell otherwise.
We request that you include the given statement, and preferably a version number also.
The motivation is two-fold:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A certain amount of publicity for the FOX Library :-).</li>
<p>
<li>Some way for recipients of your program to verify that the distribution was
made according to the FOX License. This might appease some license-vigilantes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Item d.</b> aims to differentiate between the C++ programmer's interpretation
of deriving (or subclassing), and the legal concept of making a derived work.
When you're subclassing your own class from an existing FOX widget or other object,
you're not making any changes to the source text of the FOX Library itself, and hence
this cannot be interpreted as a <em>derivate work</em> in the legal sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<li><b>Point 3.</b> says that derivative versions of official releases of the FOX
library can NOT carry forward the License Addendum.  This point was added because
it was apparently unclear what "unmodified" meant.  With "unmodified" we mean that
the code has not been modified relative to versions available from the FOX Toolkit
web site [not counting tweaks to makefiles and packaging, of course].</li>
</ul>

<p>
<li><b>Point 4.</b> says that if you are unwilling or unable to meet these demands,
then you can always distribute your program under the original GNU Lesser General
Public License.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This concludes our remarks on the License revision; please feel free to contact me
if you have additional questions.  The rationale section will likely be expanded
when there are still questions left unanswered.
