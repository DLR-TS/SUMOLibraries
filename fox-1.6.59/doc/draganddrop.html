  <p>Drag and Drop refers to the facility in FOX that allows entities
to be dragged not just from within one part of an application to
another, but also <i>between applications.</i>&nbsp; The FOX Drag And
Drop implementation is based on the&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xdnd/">XDND Protocol</a>&nbsp;
developed by John Lindal.<br>
FOX supports the latest version (XDND 5)&nbsp; of this protocol.&nbsp;
On Windows, FOX uses a very similar protocol.<br>
As FOX provides fairly high-level API's to access these features, it is
actually fairly easy to instrument your programs with a Drag &amp; Drop
facility.</p>
  <p>For better understanding of how this works, it is important to
define some terminology first:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <b><i>Drag Source</i></b> is a FOX Widget capable of
sourcing one or more types of drag and drop data or Drag Types.</li>
    <li>A <b><i>Drop Target</i></b> is a FOX Widget capable of
accepting one or more types of Drag Types.</li>
    <li>A <b><i>Drag Type</i></b> is an abstract handle to a type of
drag and drop data.</li>
    <li>A <b><i>Drag Action </i></b>determines what happens when a
drop takes place; examples of drag actions are <i>copy</i>, <i>move</i>,
and <i>link</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As mentioned before, the Drag Source and the Drop Target may or
may not be in the same application.&nbsp; In fact, their corresponding
applications could even be running on different machines.&nbsp; We
assume, of course, that both drag source and drop target are shown on
the same display.</p>

<ul>
  <p>In order to communicate a particular data structure across
applications, both partners need to first register a <b>Drag Type</b>.&nbsp;
The Drag Type is created by calling the function:</p>
  <pre>FXDragType FXApp::<b>registerDragType</b>(const FXString&amp; name) const;<br></pre>
  <p>The registerDragType() function registers a new Drag Type "name"
with the application's display, and returns an abstract handle to the
Drag Type.&nbsp; The returned handle is used in all subsequent Drag and
Drop operations.&nbsp; The Drag Type handle is unique for the display,
that is, each application subsequently registering the same drag type
name will receive the same handle.&nbsp; Obviously, the display must
have been already opened before calling this function.</p>
  <p>It is strongly suggested that if your application intends to
communicate with others, the Drag Type Names you use should be those of
the corresponding <a
 href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/">MIME
types.</a> <br>
This guarantees everybody else's applications can make sense of drag
data originating in your application [and vice versa].&nbsp; Otherwise,
Drag Type Names can be any ASCII string sequence.</p>
  <p>A corresponding function:</p>
  <pre>FXString FXApp::<b>getDragTypeName</b>(FXDragType type) const;<br></pre>
  <p>Will return the Drag Type Name, given the Drag Type.&nbsp; You may
need to use this in case your application receives a drop of an unknown
type, and you need to decide what to do with it.</p>

  <p>In order to be able to receive drops, a FOX Widget first needs to
make itself a Drop Target.&nbsp; It does this by calling:</p>
  <pre>virtual void FXWindow::<b>dropEnable</b>();<br></pre>
  <p>To cancel drop-ability, use a function:</p>
  <pre>virtual void FXWindow::<b>dropDisable</b>();<br></pre>
  <p>A Widget will not receive drag and drop messages unless it has
been enabled as a drop target with dropEnable(). Note that the Widget
may receive drag and drop messages with drop-data it does not
understand, and thus it should only accept drops of the proper type.</p>

<ul>
  <p>FOX Widgets which have have been enabled for Drop Targets may
receive a number of messages during a drag-and-drop operation.&nbsp; To
give a user feedback about what is going on, I suggest that the Widget
somehow change its visual appearance based on receiving these messages.
  </p>
  <p>For example, a Folder Icon, normally shown in the closed state,
may be changed to the opened state to indicate that a drop is pending
and will be accepted if performed.&nbsp; Another method [which is
usually performed by the Drag Source Widget, see later], is to change
the shape of the cursor to a STOP sign when the drop will NOT be
accepted; one could also use a combination of the two methods.</p>
  <p>Drop Target Widgets may receive the following messages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>SEL_DND_ENTER</b>.&nbsp; This message is received when the
cursor first enters the Widget.&nbsp; At this point, the Widget may
inspect the Drag Types available, and determine whether or not to
accept a drop.&nbsp; If necessary, the Widget could even tentatively
request the Drop Data, and inspect the data itself.&nbsp; It must be
prepared to throw the data away again, however.</li>
    <li> <b>SEL_DND_LEAVE</b>.&nbsp; This message is received when the
cursor leaves the Widget.&nbsp; If the Widget did not receive a
SEL_DND_DROP before this message, it must release the data, if it has
requested it.</li>
    <li> <b>SEL_DND_DROP</b>.&nbsp; The Widget receives this message
when an actual drop takes place.&nbsp; Typically, the Widget requests
the Drop Data at this point.</li>
    <li> <b>SEL_DND_MOTION</b>.&nbsp; This message indicates to the
Widget the exact position of the cursor (and thus the Drop
Point).&nbsp; Simple Widgets may not care about this, but more
complicated Widgets will probably use the position to determine the
exact action to take.&nbsp; For example, depending on position, the
Widget may or may not accept certain Drop Types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At any point between receiving SEL_DND_ENTER and SEL_DND_LEAVE
/SEL_DND_DROP, the Drop Target may call the following functions to
inquire about the type of the data being dragged, the data
itself,&nbsp; and the drag-action being performed.&nbsp; Based on this
information, it can feed back information to the Drag Source to
indicate whether or not it will accept the data:</p>
  <pre>void FXWindow::<b>acceptDrop</b>(FXDragAction action=DRAG_ACCEPT);<br></pre>
  <p>To accept or reject a drop, the Widget calls <b>acceptDrop</b>()
with an argument specifying the <b>Drag Action</b> suggested by the
Drop Target.&nbsp; The Widget can call this any number of times;
however, the last value will be the one reported to the Drag Source
Widget.&nbsp; For <b>acceptDrop(),</b> the following values are valid:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>DRAG_REJECT</b>. This indicates that the Drop Target will
NOT accept any type of Drag Action.</li>
    <li> <b>DRAG_ACCEPT</b>. The Drop Target chooses to accept the
drop, no matter what the Drag Action is.&nbsp; The suggested Drag
Action is the same as the one supplied by the Drag Source.</li>
    <li> <b>DRAG_COPY</b>. The Drop Target accepts the drop, but
suggests that the Drag Action be a <b><i>copy</i></b>.</li>
    <li> <b>DRAG_MOVE</b>. The Drop Target accepts the drop and
suggests that the Drag Action be a <b><i>move</i></b>.</li>
    <li> <b>DRAG_LINK</b>. The Drop Target accepts the drop and
suggests that the Drag Action be a <b><i>link</i></b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other Drag Actions may be supported in the future.&nbsp; The Drop
Target can find out the Drag Action by calling the following function:</p>
  <pre>FXDragAction FXWindow::<b>inquireDNDAction</b>() const;<br></pre>
  <p>The Drag Source should change the cursor to reflect the Drag
Action in effect; if necessary, the cursor should change to reflect the
Drag Action suggested by the Drop Target.</p>
  <p>Normally, a Widget may get many, many SEL_DND_MOTION
messages.&nbsp; In order to cut down on the traffic, a Drop Target
Widget may indicate a rectangle and whether or not it wants further
updates while the cursor is inside this rectangle by calling:</p>
  <pre>void FXWindow::<b>setDragRectangle</b>(FXint x,FXint y,FXint w,FXint h,FXbool wantupdates=TRUE);<br></pre>
  <p>Widgets which do not care where the drop takes place may call
setDragRectangle(0,0,width,height,FALSE), which will cause the Drag
Source to send no further updates while the cursor is inside the Widget.</p>
  <pre>void FXWindow::<b>clearDragRectangle</b>();<br></pre>
  <p>Clearly, this is the opposite of setDragRectangle().&nbsp; It is
equivalent to setDragRectangle(0,0,0,0,TRUE);</p>
  <pre>FXbool FXWindow::<b>inquireDNDTypes</b>(FXDNDOrigin origin,const FXDragType*&amp; types,FXuint&amp; numtypes);<br>FXbool FXWindow::<b>offeredDNDType</b>(FXDNDOrigin origin,FXDragType type);</pre>
  <p>The first call yields an array of Drag Types currently available
from the Drag Source.&nbsp; The list is <b><i>read-only,</i></b> and
should NOT be freed.&nbsp; The Widget should <b>NOT</b> keep pointers
to this list, as the list ceases to exist after SEL_DND_LEAVE.&nbsp;
The second call tests to see if a certain Drag Type is being offered by
the Drag Source.</p>
  <p><a name="GETDNDDATA"></a>If the Drag Type information is not
enough, the Drop Target may have to inquire the actual data from the
Drag Source and inspect it.&nbsp; It does this by calling:</p>
  <pre>FXbool FXWindow::<b>getDNDData</b>(FXDNDOrigin origin,FXDragType type,FXuchar*&amp; data,FXuint&amp; size);<br></pre>
  <p>This call acquires the Drag Type type from the Drag Source.&nbsp;
Upon return, data points to an array of bytes containing the Drop Data,
and size is set to the number of bytes in the array.&nbsp; The array is
now owned by the Drop Target Widget, and should be freed with the
FXFREE() macro.&nbsp; The corresponding function in the Drag Source is
describes <a href="draganddrop.html#SETDNDDATA">elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;
The parameter <b><i>origin</i></b> should be set to <b>FROM_DRAGNDROP</b>.</p>

  <p>Making a Widget a Drag Source is comparatively easy.&nbsp; The
transaction begins when the mouse button goes down.&nbsp; The Widget
will need to call <b>grab()</b> to capture the mouse to the Widget, so
that all future mouse events will be reported to the Widget, even if
they occur outside of the Widget. Next, the Widget will call:</p>
  <pre>FXbool FXWindow::<b>beginDrag</b>(const FXDragType *types,FXuint numtypes);<br></pre>
  <p>to start a drag-operation.&nbsp; The arguments to <b>beginDrag() </b>describe
the list of types [which must have been registered previously] which
are being offered.&nbsp; The Drag Source must be willing to furnish
each of these types when requested by the Drop Target.&nbsp; The <b>beginDrag()</b>
function returns FALSE if it failed to initiate a drag operation; the
application should not proceed with dragging in this case.</p>
  <p>Upon each mouse movement, the Drag Source needs to indicate the
new mouse position to the system; it also notifies the Drop Target of
the new Drag Action.&nbsp; It does this by calling the function:</p>
  <pre>FXbool FXWindow::<b>handleDrag</b>(FXint x,FXint y,FXDragAction action=DRAG_COPY);<br></pre>
  <p>The <b>handleDrag()</b> function determines the Widget under the
cursor, and issues a SEL_DND_ENTER when it first enters a Widget, a
SEL_DND_LEAVE when it leaves the Widget, and a SEL_DND_MOTION when the
cursor simply has moved over the Widget [subject to the drag rectangle
set by the Drop Target].&nbsp; It will not send any messages if the
widget under the cursor has not called <b>dropEnable() </b>first to
enable drops on it.</p>
  <p> The <b>handleDrag() </b>function may return FALSE if it
fails.&nbsp; To find out if a Drag Source is in the middle of a drag
operation, applications may call the following member function:</p>
  <pre>FXbool FXWindow::<b>isDragging</b>() const;<br></pre>
  <p>While the Drag Source is dragging, it may want to inquire whether
the Drop Target's accepted or rejected a drop.&nbsp; It does this by
calling:</p>
  <pre>FXDragAction FXWindow::<b>didAccept</b>() const;<br></pre>
  <p>The function <b>didAccept()</b> simply returns DRAG_REJECT when
the Drop Target would NOT accept the drop, and returns DRAG_COPY,
DRAG_MOVE, DRAG_LINK if it did; the Drag Source should reflect the Drag
Action returned by changing its cursor. For safety's sake, <b>didAccept()
  </b>will also returns DRAG_REJECT if the Drop Target has not called <b>dropEnable(),</b>
or if the Drop Target fails to respond to any drag-and-drop messages.</p>
  <p>Applications may choose to change the cursor shape based on what
didAccept() returned, as illustrated by the following code fragment:</p>
  <pre>handleDrag(event-&gt;root_x,event-&gt;root_y);<br><br>if(didAccept()!=DRAG_REJECT){<br>  setDragCursor(drop_ok_cursor);<br>  }<br>else{<br>  setDragCursor(drop_not_ok_cursor);<br>  }<br></pre>
  <p>The rationale is that even though Drop Targets may give a visual
cue when a drop is OK, not all applications running on your system may
be drag-and-drop aware;&nbsp; changing the cursor also will give an
additional clue.</p>
  <p>When the user releases the mouse button, the Widget needs to call
ungrab() to release the mouse capture, and then calls:</p>
  <pre>  FXDragAction FXWindow::<b>endDrag</b>(FXbool drop=TRUE);<br></pre>
  <p>This will cause a SEL_DND_DROP message to be sent to the Drop
Target, if and only if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The flag drop is TRUE.</li>
    <li>The Drop Target has previously called acceptDrop().</li>
    <li>The Drag Source has received status messages back from the Drop
Target.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Passing a flag drop allows the Drag Source to deny a drop even
though the Drop Target may have accepted a drop.&nbsp; The endDrag()
function returns the action actually performed by the drop target.<br>
The XDND version 5 protocol returns the drag action performed by the
target, since in processing the drop, the target may be unable to
perform the requested action, perhaps due to some runtime error.&nbsp;
Returning the action actually performed allows the drag source to take
the appropriate action.<br>

  <p><a name="SETDNDDATA"></a>During a drag operation, a drag source
may receive one or more requests for the drag data. These requests take
the form of a SEL_DND_REQUEST message sent to the owner of the drag
data. When a drag source receives a request for its data, it should
first inspect the requested drag type, which is found in the FXEvent's <b><i>target</i></b>
member variable. If the drag source can supply its data in the
requested drag type, it should then allocate an array (using the
FXMALLOC macro) and stuff the data into it.</p>
  <p>The drag source then calls</p>
  <pre>  FXbool FXWindow::<b>setDNDData</b>(FXDNDOrigin origin,FXDragType type,FXuchar* data,FXuint size);<br></pre>
  <p>To hand the array over to the system. At this point, ownership of
the array passes to the system, and the drag source should <b>not</b>
attempt to make any further references to this array. The <b><i>origin</i></b>
parameter should be set to FROM_DRAGNDROP.</p>
  <p>The drop target may make a request for the drag data from the drag
source by calling getDNDData(), described <a
 href="draganddrop.html#GETDNDDATA">above</a>.</p>

  <p>The data exchange described above takes place using raw
bytes.&nbsp; In more realistic cases,&nbsp; complicated data structures
may have to be exchanges.&nbsp; It is important to realize that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Drag Source and Drop Target may be different
programs.&nbsp; Thus, it is usually meaningless to exchange pointers to
data structures.</li>
    <li>The Drop Target and Drag Source may not only be different
programs, but also may be programs running on different machines with
different byte orders and different word lengths.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>FOX takes care of some of the latter troubles by furnishing
special FOX primitive types, such as FXchar, FXshort, FXint and so
on.&nbsp; A FOX implementation will ALWAYS make sure these types have
the same size, although byte order may still be reversed on some
machines.</p>
  <p>More sophisticated data transfers can be accomplished using the
FOX <b>FXMemoryStream</b> class.&nbsp; The FXMemoryStream is a
subclass of FXStream that serializes/deserializes data to/from a <b>memory-buffer.</b>&nbsp;
The FXStream classes also support <i>byte swapping </i>on the reader
side, making it very convenient to exchange data between hererogeneous
machines; moreover, the FOX Stream classes support serialization of FOX
Objects.</p>
  <p>Thus, entire networks of objects may be serialized, transmitted to
the drop site, and then deserialized.</p>
  <p><b><u>Example</u></b>:
  </p>
  <p>Serialize into a buffer, then give the buffer to the DND system:
  <br>
&nbsp;
  </p>
  <blockquote><font face="Courier New,Courier">FXMemoryStream str;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXuchar *buffer;</font>
    <br>

    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXObject
*myobjectptr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Pointer to the FXObject-derived object we wish to transfer</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXuchar endianness;</font>
    <p><font face="Courier New,Courier">endianness=FXStream::isLittleEndian();</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Courier New,Courier">str.open(NULL,FXStreamSave);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// The FXMemoryStream will create its own buffer</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str &lt;&lt; endianness;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str &lt;&lt; myobjectptr;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str.takeBuffer(buffer,size);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Take ownership of the buffer away from the FXMemoryStream</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str.close();</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">setDNDData(dndtype,buffer,size);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Give the buffer to the DND system</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
Take data from the DND system, then give the buffer to the Stream
and deserialize from it:
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <blockquote><font face="Courier New,Courier">FXMemoryStream str;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXuchar *buffer;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXuint size;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXObject
*myobjectptr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// When done, this points to an FXObject-derived object</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXuchar endianness;</font>
    <p><font face="Courier New,Courier">getDNDData(dndtype,buffer,size);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Take possesion of the buffer from the DND system</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Courier New,Courier">str.open(buffer,size,FXStreamLoad);</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str &gt;&gt; endianness;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str.swapBytes(endianness!=FXStream::isLittleEndian());&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Swap bytes in the receiver if necessary!!</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str &gt;&gt; myobjectptr;</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">str.close();</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New,Courier">FXFREE(&amp;buffer);</font>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
As you see, this is a mighty fine way to transfer arbitrary objects
between
applications.&nbsp; All you have to do is derive certain objects from
the
FXObject base class, then properly inplement the <b>load()</b> and <b>save()</b>
member functions for that class, so that all object member data may be
properly serialized or deserialized.&nbsp; For more info, see the
chapter
on Serialization.

  <p>This is no hard and fast rule, but generally speaking when data
are being dragged <b>within</b> the same window, the default Drag
Action should default to DRAG_MOVE, whereas when dragging <b>between</b>
windows, the Drag Action should default to DRAG_COPY.&nbsp; These
defaults can be overridden by holding down the Control-Key, which
should force a DRAG_COPY, or the Shift-Key, which should force a
DRAG_MOVE.&nbsp; Holding down the Alt-Key should probably force a
DRAG_LINK.</p>

<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>There are two major schools of thought; some people prefer to let
animate or highlight the drop-site to indicate an impending accept or
reject of a drop, whereas others change the cursor instead.&nbsp; Apart
from psychology, my take on this is do both:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Changing the cursor has the advantage that there is some
feedback while moving over inert backgrounds.</li>
    <li>Changing the drop site has the advantage that it is very clear
where the dropped data will wind up, especially if drop sites may be
very small on the screen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This reflects my view that in the software world, we can make our
own rules;&nbsp; we can diverge from the physical model of
``manipulating rigid objects'' if this is appropriate or gives the user
a better handle on things.</p>
