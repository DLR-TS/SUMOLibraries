2015-08-03 19:14  robert

	* include/osgViewer/api/X11/PixelBufferX11,
	  src/osgViewer/PixelBufferX11.cpp: From Andy Skinner, "Someone was
	  using our code on a system that does not seem to have the SGIX
	  symbols used in osgViewer.cpp.
	  
	  
	  
	  I used osgSetGLExtensionsFuncPtr to remove the symbols. I don't
	  know how to test this path, but it did remove the symbols from
	  libosgViewer.so. I have also not been able yet to see if that was
	  sufficient for our customer.
	  
	  
	  
	  I did this by looking at other cases, and I tried to follow some
	  of the same practices in PixelBufferX11, like using _useSGIX in a
	  similar way to the previous _useGLX1_3."

2015-07-31 15:12  robert

2015-07-31 15:01  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated rc number to 8 for 3.4.9-rc8

2015-07-31 13:47  robert

	* CMakeModules/OsgAndroidMacroUtils.cmake: From Terry Welsh, "I
	  downloaded the Android 3rdparty deps from here
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/dependencies
	  but was not able to use them for a while. Attached are changes to
	  OsgAndroidMacroUtils.cmake that allow the deps to be found by
	  cmake.
	  
	  Specifically, all FIND_PATH commands require the
	  NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH option to actually find paths. This is
	  odd
	  because if you inspect CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH it appears to be
	  empty. I
	  would expect it to have no effect at all.
	  
	  I also needed to remove quotes from this line in order for
	  headers to be found:
	  
	  set(FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS "${FREETYPE_DIR}/include
	  ${FREETYPE_DIR}/include/freetype/config")
	  
	  Assuming this script worked in the past, it seems like cmake
	  behavior
	  may have changed at some point. I'm using cmake version
	  2.8.12.2."

2015-07-31 13:44  robert

	* src/osg/GLExtensions.cpp: From Jannik Heller, "Here is a patch
	  for the S3TC capability check.
	  
	  On a Intel HD graphics Linux system with Mesa 10.1.3, I found
	  that osg's Extensions::isTextureCompressionS3TCSupported()
	  returned false, even though S3TC compressed textures *are* in
	  fact working. I tested this by loading and rendering various
	  DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5 compressed textures in the OSG.
	  
	  "glxinfo | grep s3tc" gives:
	  GL_S3_s3tc
	  
	  Note, if I install the package "libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0", I get in
	  addition:
	  
	  glxinfo | grep s3tc
	  GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
	  GL_S3_s3tc
	  
	  However, S3TC compressed textures worked correctly within the OSG
	  even without libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 installed.
	  
	  I'm not sure what the differences between these extensions are,
	  but based on the description at
	  https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/S3/s3tc.txt I would assume
	  that both will work for OSG's purposes. The attached patch
	  changes isTextureCompressionS3TCSupported() to accept either
	  extension."

2015-07-16 15:56  robert

	* src/osgQt/GraphicsWindowQt.cpp: From Cory Slep and Robert
	  Osfield, "When using Open Scene Graph and Qt on Android, the
	  resulting thread that an application developer’s Q*Application is
	  run on is different than what Qt considers the “main” thread,
	  which can cause subtle problems. This is because Qt loads native
	  libraries in one thread, and later runs the application in a
	  different thread. They delay running in the second thread as long
	  as possible as they have a nontrivial bootstrapping process. The
	  motivation for Qt having this second thread is to allow them to
	  remain responsive to both Java and native events, and capture
	  events that would otherwise be “missed”

2015-07-16 11:01  robert

	* src/osgText/Text.cpp: Added check to catch cases where the

2015-07-14 13:33  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Moved the cmake_policy(SET CMP0043 NEW) to work

2015-07-14 13:26  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Added cmake_policy(SET CMP0043 NEW) usage when
	  compiling against Qt5 as it was causing a warning we couldn't fix
	  on the OSG side otherwise.

2015-07-14 08:25  robert

	  mismatches into osgQt as suggested in
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=14999.
	  
	  When an application is built with Qt4, but osgQt was built with
	  Qt5 (or vice versa), upon #includeing osgQt users will receive an
	  #error aborting the build.
	  
	  This at least provides a proper error message rather than a
	  crash, while we are working on better fixes for the problem."

	* From Laurens Voerman, "attached is a zip with the files:
	  
	  OpenSceneGraph\CMakeModules\FindOpenEXR.cmake
	  
	  I introduced a bug in the previous submission pointed out by
	  Dmitry Marakasov:
	  looking for IlmIlf instead of IlmImf (as the previous version did
	  - but using variable OPENEXR_IlmIlf_LIBRARY)
	  
	  For some reason google decided his message was spam, so I just
	  noticed it, and I reply to confirm his remarks and attach a full
	  file.
	  
	  "

2015-06-10 16:47  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "An earlier fix in OSG 3.2 has been
	  inadvertently lost in 3.3.x. The glGenerateMipMap function is
	  part of the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension. Just checking if
	  the function is present before using it for texture mipmaps is
	  not sufficient, as on remote X-windows displays the client side
	  capability may be different from the display server. This can
	  lead to mipmapped textures failing to render. I've restored a fbo
	  extension check. I've also tided up the GL version checking a
	  little."

2015-06-10 10:00  robert

	* From Philippe Renon, "Fixed potential divide by zero in
	  NodeTrackerManipulator : The divide by zero happens when throwing
	  a NodeTrackerManipulator.
	  The infinite result trickles down and later causes NaN in
	  culling.
	  
	  The fix was to use getThrowScale() as done everywhere else."

2015-06-09 16:49  robert

	* Added supoort for
	  osg::CullSettings/Camera::InheritanceMaskActionOnAttributeSetting
	  and InheritanceMask properties.

2015-06-09 09:44  robert

	* Added output of HUD scene graph to hud.osgt and hud.osgb for
	  testing purposes.

2015-06-08 11:33  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS and ChangeLog for dev release

2015-06-08 11:18  robert

	* From Mike Connell, "Give ReadFileCallback access to parent
	  location : These small changes to the database pager allow user
	  code in the ReadFileCallback to safely determine where the file
	  being loaded is destined to be inserted into the scenegraph.
	  "

2015-06-08 10:20  robert

	* Addressed race condition where SceneView::setLightingMode() was
	  setting a shread Master Camera's StateSet.

2015-06-07 11:13  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, Removed unused
	  StatsHandler::_keyEventToggleVsync

2015-06-04 09:00  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, "In the attachment you will find a build fix
	  for the latest trunk. osgAnimation failed to compile when using
	  OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION=OFF ."

2015-06-03 10:28  robert

	* Removed export that was breaking windows build

2015-06-03 09:14  robert

	* From KOS, "New classes for osgAnimation presented:
	  UpdateFloatUniform, UpdateVec3fUniform and UpdateMatrixfUniform
	  (based on UpdateUniform template)
	  
	  
	  Classes operate like osgAnimation::UpdateMaterial for Material's
	  diffuse component, but change Uniform."

2015-06-03 09:07  robert

	* From KOS, build fix for osg::Uniform::Callback to
	  osg::UniformCallback change

2015-06-03 09:06  robert

	* Build fix for when Uniform::Callback isn't defined

2015-06-02 10:25  robert

	* From Konstantin Matveyev, serializer support for UniformCallback

2015-06-02 09:33  robert

	* From Konstantin Matveyev, "I've changed osg::Uniform::Callback to
	  osg::UniformCallback.
	  osg::UniformCallback inherits osg::Callback now.
	  
	  I don't really now if this class should be inside
	  osgWrappers/serializers
	  because StateAttributeCallback is not presented there, but i've
	  included it in the patch.
	  
	  
	  Please see archive in the attachment.
	  
	  
	  PS
	  DEEP_COPY_UNIFORMS works for me.
	  "
	  Note from Robert Osfield, added typedef UniformCallback Callback
	  for backwards compatibility.

2015-06-02 09:18  robert

	* Changed name of UniformCallback to UniformBufferCallback to avoid
	  conflict with changes to come to the osg::Uniform::Callback ->
	  osg::UniformCallback.

2015-06-01 13:40  robert

	* From Albert Luaces, typo fixes.

2015-06-01 13:11  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, typo fixes

2015-06-01 12:14  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, "This patch adds a missing initialization of
	  osgParticle::ParticleProcessor::_frameNumber in the copy
	  constructor.
	  I noticed this because valgrind was complaining about use of
	  uninitialized memory."

2015-06-01 12:07  robert

	* From Frashud Lashkari, "I was getting "Unsupported wrapper
	  class..." error messages when attempting to load osgb models
	  simultaneously from multiple threads. I believe the problem is
	  caused by un-synchronized access to the global
	  osgDB::ObjectWrapperManager class. I've attached a change that
	  adds a mutex to the class and uses it when accessing the internal
	  wrapper/compress maps. This appears to fix the issues I was
	  having."

2015-06-01 10:50  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, "I have added new functions
	  Texture::generateAndAssignTextureObject mirroring the
	  Texture::generateTextureObject functions.
	  
	  I have left the Texture::generateTextureObject functions intact
	  as I'm not sure if/how it's used outside the core OSG. If you
	  feel that compatibility isn't important in that area feel free to
	  drop it.
	  
	  While testing the build with
	  OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION=OFF I found a compile
	  error in GlyphGeometry.cpp that was entirely unrelated to the
	  changes I've made. The fix is included in the patch.
	  
	  There is one thing left to fix and that is
	  Texture2D::SubloadCallback:
	  
	  class OSG_EXPORT SubloadCallback : public Referenced
	  {
	  public:
	  ....
	  virtual TextureObject* generateTextureObject(const Texture2D&
	  texture, State& state) const
	  {
	  return osg::Texture::generateTextureObject(&texture,
	  state.getContextID(), GL_TEXTURE_2D);
	  }
	  ...
	  }"
	  

2015-06-01 10:41  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, build fix

2015-05-29 07:52  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, fix for race condition in orphanded
	  BufferObject handling.

2015-05-26 17:24  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "rc/osgUtl/MeshOptimizers.cpp won't compile
	  on some systems due to a missing std:: namespace prefix."

2015-05-26 17:22  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "attached a small change to
	  osgUtil::SceneView that prevents unnecessary calls to glClear
	  when the split stereo separation is 0."

2015-05-26 17:17  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth, "Little fix for
	  ClassInterface::getSupportedProperties, before if you set
	  searchAssociates to false then it would return the same
	  BaseSerialiser::Type for every entry in the PropertyMap as i was
	  not being incremented on line 539. Fix attached."

2015-05-26 17:12  robert

	* From We See, "I found a small bug in osgUtil::RenderStage::draw()
	  (osg 3.3.7), which crashes osg. The problem was caused by an
	  access to the object _camera without checking whether the object
	  is valid. So I changed the line:
	  
	  Code:
	  if (_cameraRequiresSetUp ||
	  (_cameraAttachmentMapModifiedCount!=_camera->getAttachmentMapModifiedCount()))
	  
	  to
	  
	  Code:
	  if (_cameraRequiresSetUp || (_camera.valid() &&
	  _cameraAttachmentMapModifiedCount!=_camera->getAttachmentMapModifiedCount()))
	  "

2015-05-26 17:09  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari and Robert Osfield, "a small change to the
	  CullVisitor class, which will use cloneType() on the root render
	  stage when creating children render stages. This allows us to
	  pass a custom RenderStage object to the SceneView and have it
	  used for all sub-stages."

2015-05-26 10:05  robert

	* Rewrote the Text3D bevel implementation to automatically adjust
	  bevel thickness to avoid overalapping and erronous tesselation.
	  
	  Added osgText::Bevel::s/getRoundedConcaveJunctions(bool) to
	  control how the bevel should be tessellated around concave
	  junctions on the glyph boundary.

2015-05-26 08:48  robert

	* Added use of ref_ptr<>

2015-05-25 12:39  robert

	* Changed the EventQueue::frame() event generation to use the
	  generatePointerData/reprojectPointerData() methods in the same
	  way that other events are handled.

2015-05-25 11:33  robert

	* Added osgGA::GUIEventAdapter* returns from various EventQueue
	  event generation methods.

2015-05-21 14:11  robert

	* Fixed memory error associated with reading over the end of
	  container due to an unbounded while loop.

2015-05-06 18:39  robert

	* Update ChangeLog and AUTHORS file

2015-05-05 11:05  robert

	* Changed the CMP0020 check to > 2.8.10

	* From Christian Kehl, changes for making osgAndroid working with
	  GLES1 enabled

2015-04-30 13:59  robert

	* From Dmitriy Ogalcev, fix for crash when calling setCursor from a
	  non GUI thread

2015-04-28 16:12  robert

	* Replaced attempt at passing NULL Matrix with two specialized
	  methods.

2015-04-27 19:31  robert

	* Renamed LineSegment::intersect(BoundingSphere/Box, double/float&,
	  double/float&) methods to
	  LineSegment::intersectAndComputeRations(..) to avoid confusion
	  with the change in convention for
	  the old intersect(BoundingBox&, float/double&, float/double&)
	  method as it was inconsitent with the rest of the OSG including
	  the intersect(BoundingSphere) method in how the ratio for the
	  second intersection was measure from - original from the end
	  point, but now made consistent with other places in the OSG so be
	  based on ration from start to end of segment.

2015-04-23 14:44  robert

	* Refactoring GlyphGeometry Boundary class to facilate better bevel
	  overlap detection

2015-04-23 12:58  robert

	* Comment out debug notification

2015-04-23 09:49  robert

	* Removed unused method

2015-04-22 14:25  robert

	* From Giampaolo Vigano, "please find attached a further fix for
	  3ds plugin: now reflection map works also with transparent
	  objects (I also removed a redundant setting of BlendFunc)."

2015-04-21 17:29  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "I found a couple of memory leaks in 3DS
	  reader plugin and I have attached corrected files. I have
	  attached an example 3DS file I used to test the leaks/fixes using
	  osgviewer for trunk at rev [14853] and the tagged version 3.2.1.
	  
	  The first leak is in the lib3ds module (yeah, I know that
	  probably should be corrected at http://code.google.com/p/lib3ds/
	  but I'm assuming that as no commits have happened there since
	  2011 that it may be better to fix the copy we have in the OSG of
	  that project) The leak is caused by lib3d's use of realloc(ptr,
	  0) to free up memory allocations, but realloc, when ptr==NULL
	  returns malloc(0) rather than NULL and thus leaks a zero byte
	  allocation. The solution here was to adjust the
	  'lib3ds_util_reserve_array' function so that it realloc is not
	  used to release a NULL pointer.
	  
	  The second leak is in ReaderWriter3DS.cpp and arises when any of
	  the created StateSet objects added to the StateSetMap don't
	  subsequently get applied to a Node. The solution here was just to
	  simply use the osg::ref_ptr around the raw StateSet pointer that
	  was used in the locally defined StateSetInfo struct."

2015-04-20 10:41  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS

	* Moved uniform substitution to infront of vertex attribute
	  substituion to make sure gl_Vertex usage is replaced when
	  required.

2015-04-20 09:08  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "The order_by_primitive_mode comparer was not
	  providing a strict weak
	  ordering, which was causing a crash in the sort() call in
	  VertexAccessOrderVisitor::optimizeOrder (gcc 4.9, Fedora 21)."

2015-04-17 14:36  robert

	* Updated dev release number

2015-04-17 13:33  robert

	* Added implementations for the libraryName and className for the
	  AntiSquish node.

2015-04-17 13:24  robert

	* Fixed CollectParentPaths visitor so that it sets the
	  setNodeMaskOverride(0xffffffff) to make sure all parents are
	  traversed to find parents, even ones that have their NodeMask set
	  to 0x0.

2015-04-17 13:22  robert

	* Added --test-NodeMask option to test crash when a parent of
	  osgmanipulator::AntiSquish node has a NodeMask set to 0x0.

2015-04-16 11:19  robert

	* Changed MSVC version test to <= to enable fallback for VS2010.

2015-04-16 10:07  robert

	* Fixed crash when AntiSquish node is the root of the scene graph.

2015-04-15 18:34  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2015-04-15 18:05  robert

	* Updated version number of dev release

2015-04-15 17:12  robert

	* Added missing const to find VS2005 build

2015-04-14 18:16  robert

	* Added check for changes to window size during
	  GraphicsWindowWin32::init() to fix bug that occurs when the
	  window manage resizes the window automatically on creation.

2015-04-14 15:50  robert

	* From Philippe Renon, MingW build fix

2015-04-13 11:48  robert

	* Fixed typo of SEPARATE enums

2015-04-13 10:43  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, typo fixes

2015-04-13 10:11  robert

	* From Konstantin Matveyev, "I've added GLES3 profile, which also
	  enables GLES2 features (OSG_GLES3_AVAILABLE=true =>
	  OSG_GLES2_AVAILABLE=true).
	  
	  If OSG_OPENGL_PROFILE="GLES3" =>
	  GraphicsWindowIOS will create gles3 context.
	  If failed, GraphicsWindowIOS will create gles2 context.
	  Multisampling also working.
	  
	  "

2015-04-13 09:50  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, I have modified the FindOpenEXR.cmake to
	  find the debug libraries, and to define a variable
	  (OPENEXR_LIBRARIES_VARS) with the variable names that might have
	  a _DEBUG version defined.

2015-04-13 08:55  robert

	* Added passing of command line arguments to viewer construction to
	  allow one to specify extra controls for the viewer such as window
	  size etc.

2015-04-09 18:42  robert

	* Refactored AntiSquish::computeUnSquishedMatrix() method to use
	  the parent node path of the AntiSquish node
	  to compute the required matrix rather than using the NodePath
	  provided by the NodeVistor. This is required
	  as in osg::computeLocalToWorld() usage case the NodeVisitor
	  pointer is NULL, so the correct matrix isn't possible to compute.

2015-04-09 18:38  robert

	* Added WindowSizeHandler to osgmanipulator example

2015-04-07 18:01  robert

	* Added reading of EXIF_Orientation tags when present in a jpeg
	  file.

2015-04-02 10:12  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, Windows build fixes, "These are the
	  tweaks I had to make. JSON_Objects / json_stream headers
	  attached. I am not sure how these will behave on VS 2010. Someone
	  with VS 2010 should test it. Should be okay on VS 2008 and below
	  + VS 2012 and above, though."

2015-04-01 09:37  robert

	* From Lionel Largarde, "fix for the
	  Image::computeNumberOfMipmapLevels method. The method did use the
	  float version of the log function and the / operator.
	  It works for most of the input sizes, but fails for 8192,
	  32768...
	  For 8192, the method returns 13 instead of 14."

2015-03-31 19:31  robert

	* Fixed crash when using a subload callback, where the _images
	  array is empty by _images[0] was still being accessed.

2015-03-31 19:29  robert

	* Added --subload command line option and test subload callback for
	  testing purposes

2015-03-31 16:23  robert

	* Introduced osg::Camera::resize(..) method and associated enum
	  thus:
	  
	  enum ResizeMask
	  {
	  RESIZE_VIEWPORT=1,
	  RESIZE_ATTACHMENTS=2,
	  RESIZE_PROJECTIONMATRIX=4,
	  RESIZE_DEFAULT=RESIZE_VIEWPORT|RESIZE_ATTACHMENTS
	  };
	  
	  /** Resize, to the specified width and height, the viewport,
	  attachments and projection matrix according to the resizeMask
	  provided.
	  * Note, the adjustment of the projection matrix is done if the
	  RESIZE_PROJECTIONMATRIX mask to set and according to the rules

	  void resize(int width, int height, int
	  resizeMask=RESIZE_DEFAULT);

2015-03-31 15:08  robert

	  resize all the Texture and Image assigned the the Camera
	  attachments.

2015-03-31 10:41  robert

	* Refactor the RTT Camera resize code into a seperate Callback
	  method in prep for this all being done by a single Camera API
	  call.

2015-03-31 10:36  robert

	* Added Camera::dirtyAttachmentMap(),
	  Camera::s/getAttachmentMapModified() value and usage of this in
	  RenderStage as a new mechanism
	  for telling the rendering backend to update itself to reflect new
	  values in the attachments such as new texture or image sizes.

2015-03-23 11:36  robert

	* Added StatsHandler to osgtessellationshaders example to test out

	  the windows resizes.

2015-03-20 15:49  robert

	* Fixed resize dimensions of X11 window

2015-03-20 11:48  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, "Fix for Qt4 multi-threaded crash. This patch
	  adds the AA_X11InitThreads flag to the QApplication setup,
	  meaning QT will call XInitThreads for us. This also bumps the
	  required QT version to 4.8+, because the AA_X11InitThreads flag
	  was introduced in that version. If that is not acceptable, we
	  could add a QT_VERSION >= 0x040800 guard, or manually call
	  XInitThreads() instead. Let me know what you think."

2015-03-19 10:49  robert

	  the structure that was present in OSG-3.2

2015-03-04 17:42  robert

	* Removed the experiemental osgPresentation classes. These are only
	  partially functional and not appropriate for the stable OSG-3.4
	  release

2015-03-03 15:26  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS for 3.3.5 dev release

2015-03-03 14:59  robert

	* Fixed ClusterCullingCallback parser problem due to osg::Callback
	  not being included in inheritance list

2015-03-03 12:56  robert

	* Restructed the checks in the
	  CollectLowestTransformsVisitor::removeTransforms() to avoid
	  benign case being flagged as warning.

2015-03-03 12:03  robert

	* From Miha Ravselj, "Regarding previous submission it was only
	  partial solution. After further testing I found similar bug also
	  in ClearNode serializer.
	  
	  //GLbitfield mask = GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT;
	  This line was problematic since it produced incorrect result when
	  let's say COLOR flag is serialized
	  it should be null as in Camera serializer or in a proposed
	  BitFlagsSerializer
	  
	  
	  This line of code caused that whenever only GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT
	  bit was written and on value read
	  GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT was restored instead of
	  GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT only.
	  
	  //GLbitfield mask = 0; //this resolves the issue same as in
	  camera
	  Also same bit-wise comparison bug was also present in write
	  method.
	  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  
	  As you can see there are total 3 bit mask serializers in OSG and
	  all 3 had bugs so I decided to add ADD_BITFLAGS_SERIALIZER and
	  replace USER serializers in osg::Camera, osg::ClearNode and
	  osgText::TextBase. I have made sure that bitflags serializer does
	  not break backwards-compatibility since it uses same code as user
	  serializer does in all 3 cases. (see tester.cpp on how
	  compatibility test was performed)"

2015-03-03 12:00  robert

	* Re-organized the #ifdef's to avoid usage of glPolyginMode under
	  GLES

2015-03-02 14:38  robert

	* Updated SO_VERSION to take account of API changes in osgDB

2015-03-02 12:11  robert

	* From Johannes Scholz, "Attached you find a patch for
	  osgDB::OutputStream and osgDB::InputStream to include
	  osg::Image::data() using Base64 encoding inside the ASCII OSGT,
	  if WriteImageHint=IncludeData is set, only."

2015-03-02 12:09  robert

	* From Michael McDonnel, "The tessellation shader example has a
	  small bug.The middle of the
	  geometry is clipped as soon as it is tessellated. The clipping is
	  probably caused by rounding errors because it is only in one
	  spot. The
	  clipping disappears when the camera is moved, and reappears when
	  it is
	  moved back. Expanding the the bounding box fixed the clipping
	  bug."
	  
	  Tweaked by Robert Osfield to expand it to a -1 to 1 unit box.
	  Actual clipping bug is not due to rounding errors but the shaders
	  creating vertices outside the bounding box of the original input
	  vertices

2015-03-01 15:20  robert

	* Fixed StateSet::Define names to match
	  OpenSceneGraph-Data/shaders.

2015-03-01 11:08  robert

	* From Jannik Heller, "I noticed the rotation in the
	  OrbitManipulator depends on the framerate. To reproduce this
	  issue, start the osganimate example, rotate the model with the
	  left mouse button, then let go of the mouse button while still
	  moving. You will notice that with V-Sync enabled, the model
	  rotates slower.
	  
	  The OrbitManipulator calculates a scale to counteract the
	  framerate dependency, but it turns out this scale wasn't used for
	  the rotation yet."

2015-02-27 10:01  robert

2015-02-26 19:51  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS

2015-02-26 19:14  robert

	* From Bradley Baker Searles, "We had someone replace a DDS texture
	  with a GL_RGB/GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_6 image, which would trigger
	  a crash in Image.cpp while flipping the mipmap chain. The code
	  was trying to flip the mipmaps using the rowStep for the
	  full-size image (we have "dds_flip" set in the
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options in the osgDB::Registry)."

2015-02-26 18:06  robert

	* From Bradley Baker Searles, "Small patch attached to handle DDS
	  flip when s=4. Currently it will omit flipping and generate a
	  warning: "Vertical flip was skipped. Image dimensions have to be
	  multiple of 4."

2015-02-26 17:49  robert

	* From Julien Valentin and Alberto Luaces, added support for

	* Updated ChangeLog

2015-02-25 19:38  robert

	* From Aitor Moreno, "Attached you will find the modified file
	  without the lines which raises the exception. "

2015-02-25 19:31  robert

	* From Jamie Robertson, "I've been using osgSim::ScalarBar to
	  display fixed range color values (e.g. red from 1-2, green from
	  3-4 etc), by setting the _numColors the same as the number of
	  actual colors in the ColorRange.
	  
	  Currently if you do this you get strange looking results as the
	  colors are calculated for values in the centre of each color
	  step, so if your steps are large, the colors are interpolated
	  sigificantly (see screen grab of red, green and blue colors for
	  illustration).
	  
	  I've attached a fix which just uses the original color values
	  whenever _numColors equals the number of actual defined colors in
	  the ColorRange. I doubt anyone would want interpolated colors in
	  these circumstances."

2015-02-25 19:25  robert

	* From Dmitry Marakasov, "While packaging osg-3.3.3 I've discovered
	  that gstreamer detection is
	  broken:
	  
	  -- Could NOT find GStreamer (missing: GSTREAMER_BASE_INCLUDE_DIRS
	  GSTREAMER_BASE_LIBRARIES GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_INCLUDE_DIRS
	  GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_LIBRARIES
	  GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-PBUTILS_INCLUDE_DIRS
	  GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-PBUTILS_LIBRARIES) (found version "1.4.5")
	  
	  though all required modules are installed.
	  
	  There are two problems: first, module names are spelled
	  incorrectly in root
	  CMakeLists.txt (e.g. gstreamer-app instead of app), so variables
	  expected
	  for them are e.g. GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_INCLUDE_DIRS instead of
	  GSTREAMER_APP_INCLUDE_DIRS.
	  
	  Second, gstreamer base component is detected as GSTREAMER while
	  checked
	  later as GSTREAMER_BASE. I've uncommented the detection as
	  GSTREAMER_BASE, but obviously that should be revisited and only
	  one
	  detection left. With this patch, gstreamer is detected properly
	  and
	  the plugins is successfully built and installed."

2015-02-25 19:19  robert

	* From Jonathan Greig, "I was testing out the example and it works
	  fine as a standalone example, but I found that it didn't work as
	  expected when adding the class to some existing code I have to
	  test it out. The osg widget was appearing but it didn't appear to
	  be updating. After tweaking it to pass on the parent QWidget
	  pointer from my code, it worked as expected. I added the
	  WindowFlags to the attached file for good measure. If you look at
	  the Qt Documentation for QWidget (
	  http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#QWidget ), you'll see that is
	  exactly where I got this from. When subclassing a widget as such,
	  you should allow the user to pass in the parent at least,
	  considering that has a major effect on how or if Qt may clean up
	  the memory."

2015-02-25 18:56  robert

	* From Andreas Henne, Support for GL3 core profile in osgText

2015-02-25 16:59  robert

	* From Michael McDonnell, "I have changed the code so that the plus
	  key increases both the inner
	  and outer tessellation. The minus key decrease both the inner and
	  outer tessellation. You can still use the arrow keys to control
	  inner
	  and outer tessellation separately."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, clean up the code to fix warnings and make
	  the coding style more consistent with the rest of the OSG.

2015-02-25 14:55  robert

	* Fixed handling of NULL entries in osg::Geometry TexCoordArrayList

2015-02-23 11:43  robert

	* From Miha Ravšelj and Robert Osfield, fix for serializer bug in
	  osgText::TextBase and osg::Camera

2015-02-23 11:07  robert

	* From Arjun Ramamurthy, fix for use of StatsHandler in
	  multipleviews/windows

2015-02-20 15:12  robert

	* Changed the toggle of defines so that it works with assumed
	  defaults now set up by the GeometryPool so that when toggling it
	  doesn't have a delay in what the user would expect

2015-02-20 15:04  robert

	* Removed redudent shaders, and updated remaining shaders to match
	  OpenSceneGraph-Data/shaders

2015-02-20 15:02  robert

	* First step of refactoring the osg::Program management in
	  osgTerrain::GeometryPool for better performance by placing
	  default osg::Program and shader defines on a single StateSet
	  below the osgTerrain::Terrain

2015-02-18 10:52  robert

	* Moved osgTerrain::GeometryPool from
	  osgTerrain::DisplacementMappingTechnique to the
	  osgTerrain::Terrain

2015-02-18 10:23  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "Attached you find a version of the
	  ReaderWriterDDS with info outputs set to OSG_INFO instead of
	  OSG_NOTICE. The old version spams the console for each loaded DDS
	  file."

2015-02-17 20:42  robert

	* Added support for DefineList to StateSet::merge(..)

2015-02-17 19:40  robert

	* From Stephan Wenglorz, "the attached fix corrects a small bug in
	  OperationThread::setDone(bool), calling it had the opposite
	  effect of what was intended, i.e. setting done to false actually
	  finished the thread. The effect was that VPB threads would exit
	  before starting osgdem when a task had been enqueued, because
	  they initially set done to false."

2015-02-17 19:22  robert

	* Removed GL_ usage in defines

2015-02-17 19:21  robert

	* Removed commented out lines

2015-02-17 10:36  robert

	* Cleaned up warning generated when compiling osgocculusviewer

2015-02-13 12:50  robert

	* Improvements to the #pragma(tic) shader composition support

2015-02-13 10:56  robert

	* Deprecated the old ShaderComposition example code so that it's
	  now only invoked if you add a --old to the osgshadercomposition
	  command line.
	  
	  Introduced a new shader composition example based on the new
	  #pragama and #define based GLSL shader/osg::StateSet::setDefine()
	  functionality now built into the core OSG.

2015-02-13 07:45  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a fix for some internal glu
	  functions so that they use size_t for computing allocation sizes
	  instead of GLint. I encountered some large images that were
	  triggering integer overflows with the current code."

2015-02-11 19:21  robert

	* Fixed warning

2015-02-11 16:41  robert

	* Added reassignment of the #version line to the first entry in the
	  source list.

	  enable backwards compatibility.

2015-02-10 17:53  robert

	* Change for new Program API

2015-02-10 17:20  robert

	* Added support for new #pragam(atic) shader composition to new
	  displacement mapping technique

2015-02-10 17:04  robert

	* Introduced new shader composition approach that utilizes #pragma
	  requires(), #pragma import_defines() and #ifdef in GLSL to enable
	  multiple different versions of shaders based
	  on defines passed in from osg::StateSet::setDefine(..).

2015-02-04 15:11  robert

	* Fixed typo.

2015-02-03 16:36  robert

	* Removed unncessary _EXT

2015-02-02 09:53  robert

	* Commented out the experimental V8 and Python plugins as these
	  plugins only existed as a proof of concept test linkage with
	  these dependenices, and have no functionality beyond this.

2015-01-27 15:07  robert

	* Replaced _EXT defines with GL-3.2 versions

2015-01-23 17:15  robert

	* From Javier Taibo,
	  "I have found a "bug" in the new audio decoding code (actually I
	  think the bug is in ffmpeg, but anyway it should be wise to
	  protect the OSG plug-in about it). I am attaching a security
	  check in FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp.
	  
	  If anybody is curious about the problem, it happens sometimes
	  when decoding an AAC audio stream. It eventually includes a PCE
	  block inside the AAC audio frame and then ffmpeg audio decoding
	  function signals a "new_frame" with 1024 samples, but a null
	  pointer instead of the audio data. It can be easily detected
	  because in these cases number of channels is 0. Maybe this is the
	  intended behaviour for ffmpeg, but I find it quite weird.
	  "
	  
	  " It seems that libav does not have a channels attribute in
	  AVFrame structure. This new version should do."

2015-01-23 13:51  robert

	* Changed osgFX::MultiTextureControl so that it uses an
	  osg::FloatArray internally to enable sharing with osg::Uniform.

2015-01-23 13:50  robert

	* Added MultiTextureControl event handling of shift 012 i.e. ')',
	  '!', '"' and 'A' to toggle full on for each of the respective or
	  all texture units.

2015-01-22 16:49  robert

	* Added #define GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS and correcte
	  GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS

2015-01-22 16:41  robert

	* From Alexey Pavlov, "Export fix for Windows platform"

2015-01-22 15:08  robert

	* Added GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS for windows build

2015-01-22 15:07  robert

2015-01-21 15:35  robert

	* From Andreas Henne, OpenGL core profile fixes required for OSX.

2015-01-21 11:09  robert

	* Added TextureWeights uniform support and controls to
	  osgFX::MultiTextureControl to support usage with shaders.

2015-01-20 18:01  robert

	* Re-enabled texturing and fixed runtime warning

2015-01-20 17:58  robert

	* Added hardwired geometry shaders

2015-01-20 17:40  robert

	* Updated shaders

2015-01-20 15:23  robert

	* Added key osgTerrain::GeometryPool methods virtual to make it
	  easier to override the shaders

2015-01-20 11:24  robert

	* Changed the reset of the GLExtensions::Set() in the State
	  destructor so that it checks to see if the local _glExtensions
	  pointer has been set up and taken ownership of the
	  GLExtensions::Set() value

2015-01-19 11:29  robert

	* Added GeometryPool::s/getUseGeometryShader() hint, and
	  OSG_TERRAIN_USE_GEOMETRY_SHADER env var for setting the default
	  value.

2015-01-16 11:03  robert

	* Added support for using geometry shaders to align the quad
	  diagonals with the local terrain

2015-01-12 10:31  robert

	* Added a local Vec3Array cache to the HeightFieldDrawable to
	  facilitate efficient intersection testing

2015-01-12 10:30  robert

	* Added ability to populate a local vertex cache for when one
	  computes final vertex position in a vertex shader but still want
	  to the Primitive functors to work with the transformed positions.

2015-01-07 14:14  robert

	* From Javier Taibo, "I have found that since version 1.1, FFMPEG
	  changed the way audio streams are retrieved, from packed to
	  planar format. SDL interprets packed audio, as is used in the
	  osgmovie example. To make the audio work when the OSGffmpeg
	  plug-in is compiled against recent FFMPEG versions,
	  FFmpegDecoderAudio must check for planar formats and in these
	  cases request the samples as packed. This way all works as
	  before. It can be checked with osgmovie example application.
	  
	  $ osgmovie --audio movie.avi.ffmpeg
	  FFmpegImageStream::open audio failed, audio stream will be
	  disabled: unknown audio format
	  
	  With the attached FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp, audio sounds correctly.
	  
	  I am also attaching a modified version of FindFFmpeg.cmake that
	  allows to set as FFMPEG_DIR the ffmpeg compiled in the source
	  directory structure. It should not break anything as it only adds
	  some additional search paths.
	  "

2015-01-07 10:36  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "small change to
	  osg::Image::readImageFromCurrentTexture to allow reading data
	  from compressed cubemap textures."

2015-01-06 17:23  robert

	* Cleaned up GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER_*ARB usage as include/osg/GLDefines
	  now provides the non ARB variants

2015-01-06 17:12  robert

	* From Julien Valentin, "To sum up changes, I had:
	  -some extensions in GLExtensions
	  - GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER as target in osg::StateSet
	  - a VBO based transform feed back example
	  "

2015-01-06 17:09  robert

	* From Julien Valentin, typo fix

2015-01-05 17:39  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a fix to the STL plugin that fixes
	  build errors introduced in the last commit. It's just a simple
	  addition of the stdint.h header."

2014-12-24 11:56  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS

2014-12-24 11:43  robert

	* Removed debug message

2014-12-24 11:25  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, Clément Léger, Aurélien Chatelain, Paul
	  Cheyrou-Lagrèze :
	  "a last submission for the obj plugin
	  * supports vertex color definition after vertex position by
	  Clément Léger
	  * supports zbrush vertex color definition (as #MRGB comment) by
	  Aurélien Chatelain
	  * adds a noReverseFace option to not mess with face definition by
	  Aurélien Chatelain
	  * makes material parsing case insensitive (by Paul
	  Cheyrou-Lagrèze and me)

	  hatelain
	  "

2014-12-24 11:02  robert

	* From Aurélien Chatelain, "adds support for
	  * quad primitives
	  * face definition with the "vertex_index" label (previously only
	  "vertex_indices" was supported)
	  * replaces normal computation by the SmoothingVisitor to avoid
	  code duplication
	  "
	  
	  Submitted by Marc Helbling.

2014-12-24 10:55  robert

	* From Aurélien Chatelain, "the smoothing visitor did not handle
	  shared arrays. It may leads to bad geometry arrays when a shared
	  array is involved in the scene.
	  This submission adds shared array duplication (and moves the
	  SharedArrayOptimizer declaration in MeshOptimizer to make it
	  callable from the SmoothingVisitor)."
	  
	  Submitted by Marc Helbling.
	  Edited by Robet Osfield to retain the usual OSG coding style.

2014-12-24 10:47  robert

	* From Aurélien Chatelain, "updates the STL plugin:

2014-12-18 09:24  robert

	* From Sukender, "Added options to the FBX writer: an ascii/binary
	  switch, and the ability to select FBX version as the SDK handles
	  it (Ex: "FBX201300").
	  
	  This allows the user to achieve backward compatibility, and debug
	  format issues using text output."

2014-12-18 09:03  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "The addition of the GStreamer cmake find
	  script broke my build because
	  cmake vars weren't passed correctly to find_package_handler_args,
	  so
	  while the find script didn't find a single required GStreamer lib
	  or
	  include path it still reported GSTREAMER_FOUND=TRUE (and then
	  tried to
	  compile the new plugin). This fixes it and correctly reports
	  missing
	  components."

2014-12-17 19:21  robert

	* Added support for using SDL2 to the osgmovie to enable it to
	  handle floating point audio formats

2014-12-17 19:20  robert

	* From Javier Taibo, " I have found that since version 1.1, FFMPEG
	  changed the way audio streams are retrieved, from packed to
	  planar format. SDL interprets packed audio, as is used in the
	  osgmovie example. To make the audio work when the OSGffmpeg
	  plug-in is compiled against recent FFMPEG versions,
	  FFmpegDecoderAudio must check for planar formats and in these
	  cases request the samples as packed. This way all works as
	  before. It can be checked with osgmovie example application.
	  
	  $ osgmovie --audio movie.avi.ffmpeg
	  FFmpegImageStream::open audio failed, audio stream will be
	  disabled: unknown audio format
	  
	  With the attached FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp, audio sounds correctly.
	  
	  I am also attaching a modified version of FindFFmpeg.cmake that
	  allows to set as FFMPEG_DIR the ffmpeg compiled in the source
	  directory structure. It should not break anything as it only adds
	  some additional search paths.
	  
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, I have found in testing that audio
	  quality is not good for planar floating point formats, even with
	  adding support for SDL2 to the osgmovie example. I haven't yet
	  tracked down the cause of these audio problems or a solution.

2014-12-17 10:19  robert

	* From Sukender, "FBX writer was writing an empty file when the
	  scene had a root node being a Geode.
	  This was caused be the change in Drawable (now derived from Node)
	  and Geode (now derived from Group).
	  This fix simply sticks with previous behaviour. Another change
	  could be to adapt WriterNodeVisitor.

	  plugin as inspiration."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, fixed handled of row widths so that they are
	  padded to a 4 byte boundary as certain row widths were being
	  rendered incorrectly.

2014-12-16 09:34  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "please find enclosed a submission that
	  should improve the VertexAccessOrderVisitor (pre-transform)
	  optimizer:
	  * it sorts primitives to keep "more complex" primitives first;
	  maybe you'll prefer to have this as an option (but usually it
	  should make more sense to pre-transform triangles before e.g.
	  lines)
	  * currently, the visitor rely on TriangleIndexFunctor and does
	  not take care of points and lines (see
	  https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg/blob/master/include/osg/TriangleIndexFunctor#L124-130).
	  This can lead to issues e.g. if you store the wireframe lines
	  along with some triangles: the triangles will be reindexed but
	  not the line. I've therefore added
	  osg/include/TriangleLinePointIndexFunctor to index triangles,
	  lines and points and derived VertexReorder from this class.
	  * to avoid issues, shared arrays are duplicated. However, in some
	  cases (e.g. an UV channel shared in the geometry only) this is
	  not required. I'm adding a SharedArrayOptimizer to optimize this:
	  it looks for duplicated UVs before the array duplication and
	  deduplicate arrays after.
	  "

2014-12-15 17:15  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "please find the mergeTriangleStrip code
	  merged in osgUtil::TriStripVisitor.
	  I've removed the references to DrawArrays as we should no longer
	  produce any.
	  
	  Note that:
	  * as the name suggest, it only works for triangle strips but
	  could probably be easily extended to quads
	  * the resulting primitive is not highly optimized; we could
	  probably sort the strips in order to minimize the number of
	  primitive restart
	  * as we may merge DrawElementsUInt and DrawElementUShort, the
	  code will only generate DrawElementsUInt"

2014-11-25 10:58  robert

	* From PawelKsiezopolski, "This submission contains a new example
	  for OSG : a geometry instancing rendering
	  algorithm consisting of two consequent phases :
	  
	  - first phase is a GLSL shader performing object culling and LOD
	  picking ( a culling shader ).
	  Every culled object is represented as GL_POINT in the input
	  osg::Geometry.
	  The output of the culling shader is a set of object LODs that
	  need to be rendered.
	  The output is stored in texture buffer objects. No pixel is drawn
	  to the screen
	  because GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD mode is used.
	  
	  - second phase draws osg::Geometry containing merged LODs using
	  glDrawArraysIndirect()
	  function. Information about quantity of instances to render, its
	  positions and other
	  parameters is sourced from texture buffer objects filled in the
	  first phase.
	  
	  The example uses various OpenGL 4.2 features such as texture
	  buffer objects,
	  atomic counters, image units and functions defined in
	  GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store
	  extension to achieve its goal and thus will not work on graphic
	  cards with older OpenGL
	  versions.
	  
	  The example was tested on Linux and Windows with NVidia 570 and
	  580 cards.
	  The tests on AMD cards were not conducted ( due to lack of it ).
	  The tests were performed using OSG revision 14088.
	  
	  The main advantages of this rendering method :
	  - instanced rendering capable of drawing thousands of different
	  objects with
	  almost no CPU intervention ( cull and draw times are close to 0
	  ms ).
	  - input objects may be sourced from any OSG graph ( for example -
	  information about
	  object points may be stored in a PagedLOD graph. This way we may
	  cover the whole
	  countries with trees, buildings and other objects ).
	  Furthermore if we create osgDB plugins that generate data on the
	  fly, we may
	  generate information for every grass blade for that country.
	  - every object may have its own parameters and thus may be
	  distinct from other objects
	  of the same type.
	  - relatively low memory footprint ( single object information is
	  stored in a few
	  vertex attributes ).
	  - no GPU->CPU roundtrip typical for such methods ( method uses
	  atomic counters
	  and glDrawArraysIndirect() function instead of OpenGL queries.
	  This way
	  information about quantity of rendered objects never goes back to
	  CPU.
	  The typical GPU->CPU roundtrip cost is about 2 ms ).
	  - this example also shows how to render dynamic objects ( objects
	  that may change
	  its position ) with moving parts ( like car wheels or airplane
	  propellers ) .
	  The obvious extension to that dynamic method would be the
	  animated crowd rendering.
	  - rendered objects may be easily replaced ( there is no need to
	  process the whole
	  OSG graphs, because these graphs store only positional
	  information ).
	  
	  The main disadvantages of a method :
	  - the maximum quantity of objects to render must be known
	  beforehand
	  ( because texture buffer objects holding data between phases have
	  constant size ).
	  - OSG statistics are flawed ( they don't know anymore how many
	  objects are drawn ).
	  - osgUtil::Intersection does not work
	  
	  Example application may be used to make some performance tests,
	  so below you
	  will find some extended parameter description :
	  --skip-dynamic - skip rendering of dynamic objects if you only
	  want to
	  observe static object statistics
	  --skip-static - the same for static objects
	  --dynamic-area-size - size of the area for dynamic rendering.
	  Default = 1000 meters
	  ( square 1000m x 1000m ). Along with density defines
	  how many dynamic objects is there in the example.
	  --static-area-size - the same for static objects. Default = 2000
	  meters
	  ( square 2000m x 2000m ).
	  
	  Example application defines some parameters (density, LOD ranges,
	  object's triangle count).
	  You may manipulate its values using below described modifiers:
	  --density-modifier - density modifier in percent. Default = 100%.
	  Density ( along with LOD ranges ) defines maximum
	  quantity of rendered objects. registerType() function
	  accepts maximum density ( in objects per square kilometer )
	  as its parameter.
	  --lod-modifier - defines the LOD ranges. Default = 100%.
	  --triangle-modifier - defines the number of triangles in finally
	  rendered objects.
	  Default = 100 %.
	  --instances-per-cell - for static rendering the application
	  builds OSG graph using
	  InstanceCell class ( this class is a modified version of Cell
	  class
	  from osgforest example - it builds simple quadtree from a list
	  of static instances ). This parameter defines maximum number
	  of instances in a single osg::Group in quadtree.
	  If, for example, you modify it to value=100, you will see
	  really big cull time in OSG statistics ( because resulting
	  tree generated by InstanceCell will be very deep ).
	  Default value = 4096 .
	  --export-objects - write object geometries and quadtree of
	  instances to osgt files
	  for later analysis.
	  --use-multi-draw - use glMultiDrawArraysIndirect() instead of
	  glDrawArraysIndirect() in a
	  draw shader. Thanks to this we may render all ( different )
	  objects
	  using only one draw call. Requires OpenGL version 4.3 and some
	  more
	  work from me, because now it does not work ( probably I
	  implemented
	  it wrong, or Windows NVidia driver has errors, because it hangs
	  the apllication at the moment ).
	  
	  This application is inspired by Daniel Rákos work : "GPU based
	  dynamic geometry LOD" that
	  may be found under this address :
	  http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/10/gpu-based-dynamic-geometry-lod/
	  There are however some differences :
	  - Daniel Rákos uses GL queries to count objects to render, while
	  this example
	  uses atomic counters ( no GPU->CPU roundtrip )
	  - this example does not use transform feedback buffers to store
	  intermediate data
	  ( it uses texture buffer objects instead ).
	  - I use only the vertex shader to cull objects, whereas Daniel
	  Rákos uses vertex shader
	  and geometry shader ( because only geometry shader can send more
	  than one primitive
	  to transform feedback buffers ).
	  - objects in the example are drawn using glDrawArraysIndirect()
	  function,
	  instead of glDrawElementsInstanced().
	  
	  Finally there are some things to consider/discuss :
	  - the whole algorithm exploits nice OpenGL feature that any GL
	  buffer
	  may be bound as any type of buffer ( in our example a buffer is
	  once bound
	  as a texture buffer object, and later is bound as
	  GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER ).
	  osg::TextureBuffer class has one handy method to do that trick (
	  bindBufferAs() ),
	  and new primitive sets use osg::TextureBuffer as input.
	  For now I added new primitive sets to example (
	  DrawArraysIndirect and
	  MultiDrawArraysIndirect defined in
	  examples/osggpucull/DrawIndirectPrimitiveSet.h ),
	  but if Robert will accept its current implementations ( I mean -
	  primitive
	  sets that have osg::TextureBuffer in constructor ), I may add it
	  to
	  osg/include/PrimitiveSet header.
	  - I used BufferTemplate class writen and published by Aurelien in
	  submission forum
	  some time ago. For some reason this class never got into
	  osg/include, but is
	  really needed during creation of UBOs, TBOs, and possibly SSBOs
	  in the future.
	  I added std::vector specialization to that template class.
	  - I needed to create similar osg::Geometries with variable number
	  of vertices
	  ( to create different LODs in my example ). For this reason I've
	  written
	  some code allowing me to create osg::Geometries from osg::Shape
	  descendants.
	  This code may be found in ShapeToGeometry.* files. Examples of
	  use are in
	  osggpucull.cpp . The question is : should this code stay in
	  example, or should
	  it be moved to osgUtil ?
	  - this remark is important for NVidia cards on Linux and Windows
	  : if
	  you have "Sync to VBlank" turned ON in nvidia-settings and you
	  want to see
	  real GPU times in OSG statistics window, you must set the power
	  management
	  settings to "Prefer maximum performance", because when "Adaptive
	  mode" is used,
	  the graphic card's clock may be slowed down by the driver during
	  program execution
	  ( On Linux when OpenGL application starts in adaptive mode, clock
	  should work
	  as fast as possible, but after one minute of program execution,
	  the clock slows down ).
	  This happens when GPU time in OSG statistics window is shorter
	  than 3 ms.

	* Commented out State::setUpVertexAttribAlias(..) debug message.

2014-11-24 15:19  robert

	* From Jan Klimke, "i noticed, that there are a couple of
	  additional flaws when building osg for Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite.
	  
	  The mac os sdk version is recognized by the current CMAKE script
	  as 10.1 instead of 10.10 since it cuts the version string from
	  the 4th place. I introduced a more reliable version checking
	  based on splitting the returned version code into MAJOR MINOR and
	  PATCH parts and reassemble the OSG sdk version afterwards.
	  
	  I replaced the existing CMake code against the following
	  (returning now version 10.10 as expected):
	  
	  # Determine the canonical name of the selected Platform SDK
	  EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND "/usr/bin/sw_vers" "-productVersion"
	  OUTPUT_VARIABLE OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME
	  OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
	  STRING(REPLACE "." ";" MACOS_VERSION_LIST ${OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME})
	  LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 0 MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR)
	  LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 1 MACOS_VERSION_MINOR)
	  LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 2 MACOS_VERSION_PATCH)
	  
	  SET(OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME
	  "macosx${MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR}.${MACOS_VERSION_MINOR}")
	  
	  Also i added the check for the new Version to some more find
	  scripts.
	  
	  Additionally the nil object in Objective C now seems to be
	  equivalent with a null_ptr that cannot be passed as GLInt
	  anymore. So i switched this in the PixelBufferCocoa.mm to pass a
	  zero instead of nil.

2014-11-21 20:15  robert

	* Added comment clarifying how Image::getColor(..) out of 0..1
	  range texcoords are handled - now clamped to edge.

2014-11-21 17:22  robert

	* Implemented a clamp to edge policy for the
	  Image::g/setColor(color, texcoord).

2014-11-21 17:17  robert

	* Added testing for Drawables in the CopyOp::operator(Node*) to
	  replicate the old functionality.

2014-11-21 16:27  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "Added setColor function to modify
	  an image based on texture coordinates, parallel to the getColor
	  functionality."

2014-11-21 14:46  robert

	* Added --db-affinit cpuNum option to osgterrain example to
	  illustrate how to set the thead affinity of the DatabasePager
	  threads.

2014-11-21 10:44  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "Attached you find a change adding
	  a getNumSamples() function to retrieve the value set via
	  setNumSamples."

2014-11-21 10:37  robert

	* From Rafa Gaitan, "I finally had some time to change the build
	  system for Android using a Toolchain, which, I think, will be
	  easier to maintain and uses cmake standard system to build it.
	  
	  My changes:
	  -------------------
	  - I changed the cmake files and added a toolchain for building
	  OSG in Android. The toolchain is based on the one used at OpenCV.
	  For building OSG for android you just need to do:
	  
	  mkdir build_android_static_gles2 && cd build_android_static_gles2
	  cmake .. -DANDROID_NDK=<path-to-the-android-ndk>
	  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../PlatformSpecifics/Android/android.toolchain.cmake
	  -DOPENGL_PROFILE="GLES2"
	  -DDYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS=OFF
	  -DDYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH=OFF
	  -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=15 # optional
	  -DANDROID_ABI=armeabim #optional
	  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-the-install-path> #optional
	  make -j 8
	  make install
	  
	  The OPENGL_PROFILE works as expected, changing it to "GLES1" it
	  builds and links OSG using GLES1.
	  The DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS/DYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH parameters also
	  allows to build the dynamic libraries
	  
	  - I also added some build fixes for android related to the
	  texture formats and added some missing USE_OSG_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER
	  in the osg serializer library to support loading osgb files in
	  static."

2014-11-21 10:21  robert

	* From Björn Blissing, fix for ambiguous defines in Atomic.cpp when
	  compiling with MinGW and GCC

2014-11-20 17:37  robert

	* From Claus Steuer, "XCode 6, IOs 8.1 SDK Compile fix : There are
	  some undefined texture formats when compiling osg for IOs 8.1
	  with XCode 6 and OpenGLES2 enabled."

2014-11-20 17:00  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I was experimenting with VBO's to try to
	  get them on par with display
	  lists when drawing lots of batches and noticed that my program
	  generated a lot of unneeded glClientActiveTexture calls. Digging
	  deeper I found out it came from State::disableTexCoordPointer
	  where
	  the function would call glClientActiveTexture but not
	  glDisableClientState because the geometry didn't have texture
	  coordinates for that channel. This is because in our scene there
	  are
	  some geometries that have move than one uv channels making
	  State::_texCoordArrayList grow. Then the method
	  State::applyDisablingOfVertexAttributes() will call
	  disableTexCoordPointer multiple times.
	  
	  I rearrange the method a little to combat this. Now the logic has
	  the
	  same ordering as disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding which
	  already combats this."

2014-11-20 16:38  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The obj loader was overriding the
	  existing database path list with the file path of the model,
	  instead of prepending the file path to the path list. The latter
	  seems to be more common behavior for most of the existing loader
	  plugins. Also, the local options weren't actually being used when
	  processing the scene graph for textures. I've attached the fix
	  for both issues."

2014-11-20 10:52  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "here is a trivial fix in the Inventor
	  plugin. In one code path, the pointer validity is checked after
	  dereferencing a pointer that can be null (image->valid()) instead
	  of calling ref_ptr::valid (image.valid())."

2014-11-20 10:45  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "I've come across scenes that contains
	  geometries with initialized but empty vertex arrays and
	  primitives and that would make some optimizers crash.
	  
	  The submission therefore only contains a test on the size of the
	  vertex array for the VertexCacheMissVisitor and the
	  VertexAccessOrderVisitor visitors."

2014-11-20 10:05  robert

	* From Christian Ruzicka, "while testing this commit on our OSG 3.2
	  version, I observed that the changes for ETC2 brake ETC1 support.
	  Attached you'll find the changes to get ETC1 running again"

2014-11-20 09:55  robert

	* From Sukender, "Fix for 3DS reader, which may read wrong
	  triangles. Actually, indices may suffer a 'short int' overflow,
	  in two places."

2014-11-20 09:41  robert

	* Fixed segfalt in Texture2DArray copy constructor where it would
	  apply images to an uninitialzed vector.

2014-11-20 09:32  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "patch adding support for ambient material in
	  the FBX plugin. It's a straightfoward adaptation of the emissive
	  support and has been tested on a proprietary model."

2014-11-20 09:21  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, fix for build breakage with giflib 5.0.

2014-11-20 08:26  robert

	* From Per Nordqvist, "The README.txt is still somewhat confusing
	  so I have updated it"

2014-11-19 17:45  robert

	* Removed configure script as it's no longer required as cmake .
	  will now default to Release

2014-11-19 17:42  robert

	* Added CMake script to set the default CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to
	  Release. Approach taken from simgear.

2014-11-19 17:29  robert

	* Fixed Contributors names

2014-11-19 17:10  robert

	* From Clement Boesch, "Fix remaining bit of Giflib5 usage"

2014-11-19 11:37  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I found a new way to crach the osgviewer:
	  osgviewer "ProxyNode { FileNameList { cow.osgt } num_children 1
	  }".osgs
	  
	  The proxy node reader wrongly assumes options to be non NULL.
	  
	  fixed in attached zip:
	  src\osgWrappers\deprecated-dotosg\osg\ProxyNode.cpp
	  
	  applies to both the 3.2 branch and svn trunk"

2014-11-19 11:30  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The submission includes some fixes for osgQt
	  library and osgQtWidgets example: (1) QTextEdit now works with
	  mouse/drag events, (2) scrollbars will change when OSG window is
	  resizing, (3) improve rendering efficiency of
	  QGraphicsViewAdapter so that it works with complex Qt UI, (4) add
	  new setBackgroundWidget() method to indicate a 'background
	  widget', which will ignore mouse/key events on it and pass them
	  to the 3D scene."

2014-11-19 10:43  robert

	* Changed the way that the cell size is passed to the shader

2014-11-19 09:33  robert

	* From James Turner, "Converting the loops to forward versions
	  fixed the issue. The problem is size_t is unsigned; at the limit
	  condition it doesn’t go negative but wraps around to
	  0xffffffffffffffff …. and boom."

2014-11-17 15:43  robert

	* Fixed typo

2014-11-17 09:19  robert

	* Fixed typo in comment

	  primitive indices required.

2014-11-14 16:47  robert

	* Implemented skirt functionality

2014-11-13 09:40  robert

	* Refactored the handling of use of the osgDB::ObjectCache in the
	  DatabasePager to use a local thread specific ObjectCache to
	  handle new additions and
	  then have these additions merged with the main Registry
	  ObjectCache during the main loop.

2014-11-11 18:28  robert

	* Moved implementation of ObjectCache functionality out of Registry
	  into a dedicated osgDB::ObjectCache class.

2014-11-10 16:04  robert

	* To handle thread safe paging and use of the osgDB::Registry
	  ObjectCache, moved the handling of cache into
	  osgDB::DatabasePager.

2014-11-06 10:44  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I tried your fix and it exposed a bug in
	  my fix :)
	  The problem is that the readObjectFields method will add the
	  object to the _identifierMap. So all the other instances of that
	  image in the same file will be replaced by the created dummy
	  object. In my fix this was an dummy image and I didn't notice it
	  in our scene's, probably because it covered a small part of an
	  object. In your fix the dummy object was not an image and that
	  leads to a crash when something tries to use it as an image. I
	  have attached a small fix for this bug.
	  
	  "

2014-11-06 10:40  robert

	* Introduced use of MarkerObject to
	  IncrmentalCompileOperation/DatabasePager as a way of marking
	  objects that have already been processed and compiled,
	  thus avoid potential threading conflicts when paged subgraphs are
	  reused.

2014-11-05 16:08  robert

	* Added handling of the reading of field properties to a dummy
	  object for cached images to avoid threading issues associated
	  with reusing and modifying an active object.

2014-11-05 13:38  robert

	* Reinstated the original mechanism for OperationThread::cancel()
	  that co-operatively releases blocks/barriers to make sure the
	  thread is able to exit correctly.

2014-11-04 20:07  robert

	* Improvements to the ShaderTerrain experiemental terrain rendering
	  technique.

2014-11-04 20:07  robert

	* Changed TerrainTile::setDirty() to use children needing update
	  traversal mechanism to address threadng issues.

2014-11-04 20:06  robert

	* Change isRunning variable to an Atomic to address possible race
	  condition asscoiated with reading and writing to the variable
	  from different threads.

2014-11-04 16:29  robert

	* Build fixes for ffmpeg LIBAVCODEC_VERSION_MAJOR >= 56

2014-11-04 11:18  robert

	* Added an InitRegistry static intiialization and destrucion static
	  to help control the order of construction and destruction of the
	  osgDB::Registry.

2014-11-04 10:46  robert

	* Replaced use of while(isRunning()) { YieldCurrentThread(); }
	  style loops with use of join() to avoid false positives being
	  reported by valgrind when using the helgrind tool for thread
	  debugging.

2014-10-21 15:08  robert

	* Added experimental osgTerrain::ShaderTerrain TerrainTechnique to
	  osgterrain example to flesh out new shader based displacement
	  mapping approach to osgTerrain databases.
	  
	  Requires shader files place in OpenSceneGraph-Data/shaders from
	  OpenSceneGraph-Data's svn/trunk to function.
	  
	  Run osgterrain example with --shader command line option to
	  select displacement mapping shader approach.

2014-10-21 14:47  robert

	* Removed --sync related code as it's now integrated into
	  osg::DisplaySettings and osgViewer

2014-10-21 14:46  robert

	* Added osg::SyncSwapBuffersCallback to include/osg/GraphicsContext
	  and support for enabling it to include/osg/DisplaySettings, and
	  to the Viewer/CompositeViewer::realize() methods.
	  
	  To enable the sync of swap buffers set the env var
	  OSG_SYNC_SWAP_BUFFERS to ON or 1, to switch off set to OFF or 0.
	  
	  One can also use the --sync command line option for application
	  that pass on command line options to the
	  osg::DisplaySettings::instance().

2014-10-21 08:27  robert

	* Removed checks against Drawable as these are no longer required.

2014-09-17 17:40  robert

	* Added support for writing the file path of a script to the lua
	  package.path to help with loading scripts within lua.

2014-09-16 17:40  robert

	* Changed osgvolume example to use the new tf plugin rather than

2014-09-09 16:12  robert

	* Improved the handling of the dialog title text

2014-09-09 15:14  robert

	* Moved the diaglog title bar widgets into the
	  Widget::GraphicsSubgraph map to avoid them poluting the Dialog's
	  children list and to prevent them from being serialized.

2014-09-09 13:37  robert

	* Introduced Widget::WidgetStateSet to help localize the StateSet
	  set up by Widget implementations from being serialized or
	  affecting what end users apply via the standard
	  Node::s/getStateSet().
	  
	  Further work on TabWidget.

2014-09-08 08:53  robert

2014-09-05 16:04  robert

	* Added shell of new osgUI::TabWidget class

2014-09-05 11:05  robert

	* Introduced support for specifying whether a serializer supports
	  different types of usage - one or more of READ_WRITE_PROPERTY,
	  GET_PROPERTY and SET_PROPERTY.

2014-09-03 15:54  robert

	* Added setting of the IsoSurfaceProperty in VolumeSettings

2014-09-03 12:28  robert

	  faster and more reliable

2014-09-02 10:00  robert

	* Improved handling of ComboBox popup toggling

2014-09-02 09:14  robert

	* Added support for scaling widgets via the scoll wheel.

2014-09-02 08:41  robert

	* Removed debugging message

2014-09-01 19:13  robert

	* Added DragCallback class to help dialog dragging support.
	  Introduced a new
	  Widget::computeExtentsPositionInLocalCoordinates() method that
	  intersects with a ray through mouse pointer and the extents of
	  the widget.

2014-08-28 15:11  robert

	* Improved support for controlling the ShadingModel via the
	  VolumeSettings object

2014-08-28 09:42  robert

	* Improved handling of VolumeSettings

2014-08-27 15:08  robert

	* Changed the osgUI behaviour so that events are set to be handled
	  by Widgets that have focus even if they don't directly use them.

2014-08-27 15:07  robert

	* Changed the NodeVisitor::apply(Drawable&) to call apply(Node&)

2014-08-27 09:25  robert

	* Added support for getting osgVolumre::Property::ModifieCount

2014-08-25 16:56  robert

	* Added Property::getModifiedCount() + dirty() to help with
	  tracking changes. Added VolumeSettings serializers for Property
	  objects

2014-08-25 13:43  robert

	* Changed StateSet::ParentList from vector<Object*> to
	  vector<Node*> to reflect that Drawable is now a Node.

2014-08-22 19:00  robert

	* Improved handling of setting of the depth of the UI.

2014-08-20 14:15  robert

	* Reordered method implemenations to make it easier to compare
	  similar methods

2014-08-19 16:58  robert

	* Added toggling on/off of the VolumeSettings ui via the 'E' key.

2014-08-19 16:37  robert

	* Updated VolumeSettings.lua reference to use ui prefix to work
	  with the new OpenSceneGraph-Data/ui/VolumeSettings.lua file.

2014-08-19 09:27  robert

	* Fixed MD2 danglng pointer crash.

2014-08-19 09:00  robert

	* Fixed build

2014-08-19 08:57  robert

	* Fixed build

2014-08-14 19:00  robert

	* Added support for ComboBox::currentIndexChanged*(uint) callback
	  API.

2014-08-13 09:24  robert

	* Resert default value to 1.0

2014-08-08 16:42  robert

	* From Ryan Kawicki, "There is an issue where the model insets of a
	  terrex terrain are being removed during the loading process. The
	  issue is described below.
	  
	  - the issue here is that the plugin is removing group nodes if
	  that group node only has one child. becuase transforms are also
	  group nodes, there were cases when the transform would have only
	  one child under it and would cause it to remove the translation
	  portion. this would cause all the vertex data to be loaded around
	  the last matrix operation, which in our case was the origin
	  (0,0,0).
	  
	  We work off of OSG 2.8.1 but see that this has not been addressed
	  on latest yet. I’ve tested this against 2.8.1 and have cleanly
	  applied it to my local repository off of latest."

2014-08-08 16:34  robert

	* From Tim George, "Currently there is a problem with using a
	  camera with a viewport with a non 0 offset and also using an FBO.
	  The problem is that only area made up of the viewports width and
	  height is drawn based on an offset of 0,0 instead of using the
	  viewports offset.
	  
	  It is caused by line 991 in RenderStage.cpp:
	  
	  
	  Code:
	  fbo_ext->glBlitFramebuffer(
	  0, 0, static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()),
	  0, 0, static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()),
	  blitMask, GL_NEAREST);
	  
	  
	  
	  which is not taking into account the viewport x and y when
	  performing the blit. It probably should be:
	  
	  
	  Code:
	  fbo_ext->glBlitFramebuffer(
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()) +
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()) +
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()) +
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()),
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()) +
	  static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
	  blitMask, GL_NEAREST);
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, made small tweak to above on merge,
	  changing the width+x to x+width to make it read more naturally.

2014-08-08 16:09  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "please find a fix for the vertex
	  pretransform visitor (VertexAccessOrderVisitor).
	  The issue with current code is that arrays are collected *before*
	  duplicating shared arrays which leads to arrays that are
	  correctly duplicated but that are not reordered.
	  
	  Also the submitted patch contains a small cleaning in
	  GeometryArrayGathrer as the _useDrawElements variable is not
	  used; it is only set in the GeometryArrayGathrer constructor and
	  VertexAccessOrderVisitor already checks that primitives have
	  indexed type."

2014-08-08 15:45  robert

	* From Glen Waldron, "Node: patch for remove*Callback() methods to
	  resolve a crash"

2014-08-08 09:28  robert

	* Changes to support building against ANDROID under OSX.

2014-08-05 18:32  robert

	* Implemented osgUI::Validator, IntValidator and DoubleValidator
	  classes that manage validation/specialization of LineEdit widgets
	  to work with just integer or double values.

2014-08-01 13:07  robert

	* Implemented callbacks for validate(), textChanged() and
	  returnPressed()

2014-08-01 10:57  robert

	* Moved responsiblity for checking current event focus onto
	  Widget::handleImplementations().
	  
	  Added support for closing CombinBox popup when the mouse is
	  clicked outside the popup or combobox widget.

2014-07-31 18:29  robert

	* Added NodeVisitor::INTERSECTION_VISITOR VisitorType

2014-07-30 12:48  robert

	* Fixed rendering of Popups

2014-07-30 12:47  robert

	* Update SO version to account for new changes to osg::StateSet and
	  osgUI

2014-07-30 12:47  robert

	* Added StateSet::RenderBinMode::PROTECTED_RENDERBIN_DETAILS and
	  OVERRIDE_PROTECTED_RENDERBIN_DETAILS options.

2014-07-29 15:50  robert

	* Added preliminary icon to ComboBox.

2014-07-29 15:50  robert

	* Fixed debug comment

2014-07-29 15:50  robert

	* Implemented prelimary icon support allowing UI widget to place
	  image and model based icons on widgets

2014-07-29 15:47  robert

	* Added catch for NULL Transform pointers getting into the
	  _transformMap.

2014-07-28 16:19  robert

	* Added handling of Drawables added directly to scene graph without
	  Geode decorating them.

2014-07-24 14:14  robert

	* Added support for changing background colour of LineEdit widget
	  when focus changes

2014-07-24 13:25  robert

	* Refined the colouring of widget to be more in sync with the
	  defaults used in Qt.

2014-07-23 16:36  robert

	* Added VolumeSettings::Filename property.

2014-07-23 15:57  robert

	* Changed the default text colour to black

2014-07-23 14:50  robert

	* Added writeFile support

2014-07-23 10:49  robert

	* Added Node:getNumParents() and Node:getParent(index) support

2014-07-22 16:02  robert

	* Removed State::AppliedProgramObjectSet container and Obsever
	  usage from osg::State to address threading bug crash.
	  
	  The State::AppliedProgramObjectSet wasn't ever being used
	  actively in the current rev of the OSG so populating and clearing
	  was no longer neccessary, allowing the code to be removed
	  completely.

2014-07-21 16:36  robert

	* Centralized the calling of #include <stdint.h> and VS fallback
	  into include/osg/Types header

2014-07-21 14:32  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I think I spotted some unneeded ref_ptrs
	  in the cullvisitor. The call
	  pushModelViewMatrix or pushProjectionMatrix will already keep the
	  reference when adding it to the MatrixStack. In
	  CullVisitor::apply
	  methods for the billboard and the camera you already take a

2014-06-27 15:57  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I made a small change to
	  DataOutputStream.cpp which makes saving Geodes possible again.
	  This is only half a fix as it only will save a Drawable that is
	  part of a Geode. But this change does not require a version bump
	  of the .ive format. I tried it with a few datasets we have here
	  with the 3.2 stable branch and the trunk with this patch and
	  there was no difference in the .ive files that were produced."

2014-06-26 11:49  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "I've applied a simple fix for the
	  backward animation support in osg::Sequence.
	  It will simply use the sign of the speed set in the getNextValue.
	  Attached file is against trunk."

2014-06-26 11:11  robert

	* From Lauren Voerman, "In order to speed up loading large scenes
	  (especially from network disk) I added code to our viewer to
	  setup multiple database-pagers and request the files trough a
	  database-request:
	  databasePager->setUpThreads(16, 1);
	  
	  We experienced problems with multiple databasepagers loading
	  files in parallel, when two threads start to load the same file
	  (usually a texture referenced by multiple models). The second
	  thread to add the file to the cache (sometimes) manages to do so
	  while the refcount from the cached object still is zero, causing
	  the object loaded to be destroyed.
	  Sometimes the second thread manages to ref() the object before
	  Referenced::signalObserversAndDelete does the final recount
	  check, causing a warning:
	  "Warning Referenced::signalObserversAndDelete(,,) doing delete
	  with _refCount=1"
	  
	  With a deleted object added to the scenegraph we get some
	  undesired results, I think the program only crashes if the object
	  was a Node, and just has some untextured surfaces if it was a
	  texture, but I'm not completely sure.
	  
	  Attached is a modified version of the Registry.cpp, returning the
	  object in cache and let the duplicate loaded object to be
	  destroyed.
	  
	  A more efficient option would be to add some sort of blocking
	  entry to the objectcache to stop the second thread from reading
	  the file, and just wait until the first thread added it to the
	  cache. If you think that's worthwile we would be happy to
	  implement that version. A bit tricky to implement and test,
	  that's why I submit a simple version that stops my program from
	  crashing."

2014-06-26 11:09  robert

	* Removed erroneous character

2014-06-26 10:53  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari,
	  "I noticed that Text3D objects would change there z alignment
	  depending on the alignment mode. I'm not sure if this was
	  intentional or just a simple mistake. My expectation was that the
	  front of the object would always stay aligned to the 0 z-plane,
	  regardless of the alignment mode. I've attached an updated
	  version that retains a consistent z-alignment."
	  "I just now noticed another issue with Text3D objects. It was not
	  properly computing the bounding box when non-axis aligned
	  rotations were being applied. In this case all corners of the
	  bounding box need to be transformed in order to get the correct
	  containing box. I've attached the updated file."
	  "The incorrect bounding box problem also applies to regular Text
	  objects. I've attached the fix for that as well as the original
	  Text3D fix."

2014-06-26 10:45  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "For a scene with a lot of animated agents
	  I did some small
	  optimizations to reduce cpu overhead:
	  1) Avoid a load-hit-store in UpdateBone.
	  b->getMatrixInBoneSpace()
	  returns the same matrix that was just stored with b->setMatrix()
	  2) Avoid calling element->isIdentity() for the whole transform
	  stack
	  (can be expensive is element is a matrix)
	  3) Make the key frame interpolator use binary search instead of a
	  linear one. This is very noticeable in scenes where some geometry
	  has
	  long repeating animations that start at the same time, you will
	  see
	  the update time grow then reset and grow again."

2014-06-26 10:24  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "while debugging ImageSequence I had a
	  crash, due to the very large frametimes caused by halting the
	  program. The problem is that when the frame time exceeds the
	  length of the entire image sequence, a looping sequence will try
	  to read it's _imageDataList beyond its size.
	  fix attached for src/osg/ImageSequence.cpp"

2014-06-26 10:05  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "while testing databasepager stuff I
	  noticed that the various loaders (osg/ive/osgx) do not pass the
	  current options to the imagePager, therefore the images cannot be
	  found if not in the global OSG_FILE_PATH. Attached is a fix,
	  containing modified versions of
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, add check to only apply Options object when
	  a valid Option object is assigned.

2014-06-26 09:38  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a small fix for the ply
	  loader to support Windows style line endings when reading the
	  header."

2014-06-26 09:33  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "This submission fix all my problems with
	  reading / writing "osgb" files inside "osga" archive with final
	  archive size > 2 Go, with Windows OS (didn't tested with Linux)"

2014-06-25 16:05  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, "there's an inconsistency between the
	  behavior of the method and the
	  debug message it prints out on the console.
	  
	  Around line 1040 of Registry.cpp (see code below) the method
	  returns
	  "simpleFileName" but prints about returning "filename".
	  
	  In attachment the modified file, based on osg 3.2.0
	  ricky
	  
	  
	  <code>

	  "

2014-06-25 15:55  robert

	* From Auelien Albert, "I'm working on an application which use 3ds
	  file format as input and use the name of the material to "map"
	  specific data with 3d geometry.
	  
	  The osg 3ds plugin modify the exported materials name in the same
	  way it modifies the node names.
	  
	  I've added an option to preserve originals materials names, with
	  the assurance of unique material names are preserved."

2014-06-25 15:47  robert

	* Refactored the way that hole are pruned from the occluder hole

	* From Laurens Voerman, "a minor patch for osgconv to make sure the
	  helptext is printed if you run "osgconv -h" with OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL
	  set too low.
	  applys to both trunk and stable branch."

2014-06-25 10:45  robert

	* From Mikhail Izmestev, "Attached fix to avoid vector usage in
	  StateGraph::prune and reduce heap allocations."
	  
	  Notes from Robert Osfield, ammended the erase so that it
	  explictly increments the iterator before the erase call.

2014-06-25 09:58  robert

	* changed debug message to use OSG_DEBUG

2014-06-25 09:57  robert

	* From Alexander Sinditskiy, "My changes added support for
	  gltexstorrage2d for texture2d.
	  
	  Initially I described issue in message:
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=13820
	  It solves issue with compiling texture using ico from image with
	  mipmaps
	  
	  I added enviroment variable OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE_ENABLE to
	  control usage of glTexStorage2d. Initially it is disabled.
	  
	  It used only if image have mipmaps.
	  
	  Another issue is converting from internalFormat + type to sized
	  internal format. I created sizedInternalFormats[] struct where
	  sized internal formats are ordered from worse->best.
	  also this struct have commented lines. Commented formats are
	  listed in
	  http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glTexStorage2D
	  but looks like not using in osg."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield. Changed the env var control to
	  OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE and made it's value true by default when
	  the feature is supported by the OpenGL driver. To disable to
	  use of glTexStorage2D use OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE="OFF" or
	  "DISABLE"

2014-06-25 08:21  robert

	  exporting to .ogst so I added them."

2014-06-24 14:58  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a small for the osg
	  ReaderWriter. It was performing a case sensitive comparison to
	  the file extension to determine whether to write the file in
	  ascii or binary. This meant that if the filename was "model.OSGT"
	  it would be treated as binary, instead of ascii. I've updated the
	  plugin to ignore case."

2014-05-21 09:07  robert

	* Added osg::runNamedCallbackObjects(..) convinience method for run
	  all named osg::CallbackObjects attached to an osg::Object

2014-05-21 09:06  robert

	* Renamed callbacks to avoid overlap with Node callbacks

2014-05-20 16:09  robert

	* Moved the _boundingSphere set method into the update section of
	  the Drawable::getBoundingBox() method
	  
	  Added an UpdateVisitor::apply(Drawable&) implementation.

2014-05-20 15:34  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I stumbled on a little bug with the new
	  drawables. I was distributing points data into different
	  drawables that I used in a LOD later. When simplifying the system
	  to not use geodes anymore I came upon the following bug:
	  If Drawable::getBoundingBox would compute an invalid bounding box
	  (if it was for example empty) it would make a bounding sphere
	  with a infinite radius which counts as a valid sphere in osg.
	  
	  Attached is a small fix."

2014-05-20 08:35  robert

	* Improved the handling of updating of text

2014-05-20 08:35  robert

2014-05-16 10:38  robert

	* Added initial shell of PushButton implementation

2014-05-15 16:30  robert

	* Added support for intesecting Drawable that are attached directly
	  to the scene graph without an osg::Geode

2014-05-15 14:57  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "There was some small error due to
	  MS non-conformity handling comments correctly."

2014-05-15 14:45  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, build fixes for VisualStudio

2014-05-15 13:34  robert

	* Added osgGA dependency

2014-05-15 13:22  robert

	* Placed the #include<osg/Node> within #ifdef OSG_USE_BOUND to
	  prevent unncessary inclusion of Node header when OSG_USE_BOUND is
	  false.

2014-05-15 09:26  robert

	* Added Node::asDrawable() and Node::asGeometry() methods to
	  provide a low cost way of casting a node to Drawable and
	  Geoemtry.
	  
	  Changed the Group::computeBound() method so that it takes account
	  of the a Drawable's BoundingBox.

2014-05-14 16:52  robert

	* Fixed the bounding sphere computation and handling of Drawable as
	  the root of the scene graph

2014-05-14 16:01  robert

	* Further work on Bound class/Node::getBound() and
	  Drawable::getBound() and usage in OSG codebase

2014-05-14 16:00  robert

	* Cleaned up code

2014-05-14 10:19  robert

	* 

2014-05-13 08:43  robert

	* Changed the Node::ParentList to be a list of osg::Node rather
	  than osg::Group, and added addChild, removeChild, replaceChild
	  virtual method to Node to enable code
	  to user code compile with minimal modifications to account for
	  the new change to the Node ParentList.

2014-05-12 12:10  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "As discussed, I've added the ability to
	  handle Drawable objects within the NodeVisitor class. Here is an
	  overview of the changes:
	  
	  - Added apply(Drawable) and apply(Geometry) to NodeVisitor
	  
	  - Added accept(NodeVisitor) method to Drawable/Geometry
	  
	  - Added traverse(NodeVisitor) to Geode which calls
	  accept(NodeVisitor) on all Drawables
	  
	  - Updated CullVisitor to use new apply(Drawable) to handle
	  drawables. The apply(Billboard) method still manually handles the
	  drawables since it is depends on the billboard settings. I needed
	  to disable the traverse within billboard to prevent duplicate
	  traversal of drawables.
	  
	  - Update other osgUtil node visitors (GLObjectsVisitor,
	  IncrementalCompileOperation, ..) to use new apply(Drawable)
	  method.
	  "

2014-05-12 11:27  robert

	* Added beginnings of new osgUI library, a replacement for
	  osgWidget that works fully in 3D/stereo and is scriptable.

2014-05-06 16:38  robert

	* Replaced obsolete __linux usage.

2014-05-06 09:43  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "Xcode changed the default
	  std-lib-implementation again. Now it’s GNU++98 instead of C++11.
	  I adapted the cMakeList.txt files accordingly to add this new
	  option so we can set it explicitly and link against
	  3rdparty-c++-libs."

2014-05-06 08:37  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "Please revert the change to
	  FindQuickTime.cmake as this breaks compilation for IOS and
	  possibly OS X."

2014-05-02 09:12  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "fix for the Collada loader where it would
	  access a null string in some cases"

2014-05-02 09:11  robert

	* From Ali Botorabi, "recently I ran into a problem with
	  Microsoft's Appverifier while using OpenThreads on win32
	  platform. The Appverifier complained about an invalid thread
	  handle during starting of a new thread. After looking closer into
	  the problem it seemed that indeed a potential root of problem may
	  be in the thread startup code. See the line below in
	  Win32Thread.cpp (line number 347):
	  
	  pd->tid.set(
	  (void*)_beginthreadex(NULL,static_cast<unsigned>(pd->stackSize),ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread,static_cast<void
	  *>(this),0,&ID));
	  
	  the method "pd->tid.set" sets the thread id, however via the
	  startup function "ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread" that thread
	  id is used (see further down the call hierarchy the line "int
	  status = SetThreadPriority( pd->tid.get(), prio);".
	  
	  Until now I never ran into any problem in debug or release
	  builds, though. It seems that furtunately the tid.set method was
	  executed always before the tid.get method in the startup code.
	  However, this may make trouble in the furture. A simple solution
	  is the following: just replace the line above with following two
	  lines:
	  
	  pd->tid.set(
	  (void*)_beginthreadex(NULL,static_cast<unsigned>(pd->stackSize),ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread,static_cast<void
	  *>(this),CREATE_SUSPENDED,&ID));
	  ResumeThread(pd->tid.get());
	  
	  
	  The trick is just starting the thread in suspended mode so the
	  StartThread function does not get executed and we can safely
	  store the tid by pd->tid.set. Then start the Thread by calling
	  ResumeThread."

2014-05-01 15:50  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, fix for OSX build

2014-04-30 13:19  robert

	* Renamed the new include/osg/OpenGL automatically configured
	  header file to include/osg/GL replacing the original hand built
	  GL header

2014-04-30 11:51  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "attached is the compile/linker fix
	  for multiple definitions of getTypeEnum when compiling the Lua
	  with VisualStudio and potentially other compilers.
	  "

2014-04-29 15:14  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "have added some missing serializers for
	  RigGeomery. Withouth them I
	  ran into two issues.
	  
	  At first you get a bunch of warnings that
	  osg::ComputeBoundCallback
	  and osg::UpdateCallback were unsupported wrapper classes when
	  converting fbx models with skeletal animation to osg(t/b).
	  
	  The second issue was that when reading, the readers fail to read
	  the
	  ComputeBoundCallback and UpdateCallback and set them to NULL
	  which
	  messes up the RigGeometry.
	  
	  Because a RigGeometry makes his own classes in the constructor it
	  might be preferable to not write them at all, because now those
	  classes are being made two times when reading a RigGeometry. But
	  after
	  thinking about this that would place too much limits on them (you
	  won't be able to share or name them and save that information or
	  make
	  a new inherited class from them and write that one) So I ended up
	  thinking the best way was to just write the files.
	  "

2014-04-29 13:41  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "Today I found a bug in the IutputStream
	  class when saving array
	  attributes in vec3b format. It looks like my compiler takes the
	  wrong
	  overload and outputs integers instead of characters. The problem
	  is
	  that vec3b is of type signed char and that is not the same as
	  char (
	  see
	  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436513/char-signed-char-char-unsigned-char
	  ) and visual studio 2013 will promote it to integer when choosing
	  an
	  overload.
	  It looks like that the InputStream class already takes care of
	  this
	  issue (if it didn't it would have read everything ok and I would
	  have
	  not even stumbled upon this bug. :) )"

2014-04-29 12:19  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "I finally got to fix the cmake Modules
	  that have duplicates in later
	  version of cmake. See attached submission. I have tested the ones

	  cmake-2.8.7."

2014-04-29 12:18  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "There is no standard place for gl/glcorearb.h
	  on Windows. Previously, the only way to get OSG to build for core
	  profile was to append an additional include directory ("/I") onto
	  the CFLAGS variables This submission adds a FindGLCORE.cmake
	  script so that the path to gl/glcorearb.h can be specified with a
	  variable, GLCORE_ROOT, either in CMake or the environment.
	  
	  Currently this submission is Windows-only. I don't think OSX or
	  Linux require any help in locating gl/glcorearb.h. But if they
	  do, this submission can be easily modified.

2014-04-28 14:58  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "I had the osgvolume example crash on me
	  when loading large volume

	  unsigned int to int. Here is a small fix."

2014-04-28 14:57  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a fix for a small race condition in
	  osgDB::makeDirectory. It attempts to create all the directories
	  in the given path and stops attempting to make directories when
	  one of them fails. I've added a check to see if the failure
	  occurred b/c the directory was created by another thread or
	  process.
	  
	  We were running into issues occasionally in osgEarth where
	  multiple threads were writing out files like /1/2/3.jpg and
	  /1/3/4.jpg. Both threads would try to create the /1 directory and
	  only one of them would succeed. So the first thread would write
	  out the full /1/2/3.jpg while the second thread wouldn't create
	  the /1/3 directory b/c /1 was already created and the writing of
	  /1/3/4.jpg would fail.
	  "

2014-04-28 11:53  robert

	* Fixed type error

2014-04-25 08:57  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "For me osgviewer.cpp and Renderer.cpp were
	  not compiling (visual studio 2013 with profile GL2) because they
	  were still using GLuintEXT. So I changed that, see the attached
	  files.
	  
	  I also noticed that the generated OpenGL header were not copied
	  to the installation directory so my own application could not
	  find it."

2014-04-25 08:56  robert

	* Reordered the configuiration file blocks to make it more
	  understandable

2014-04-25 08:18  robert

	* From Paul Martz, fixed placement of OpenGL header so that it gets
	  generated and placed in the build directory as per the Config
	  file

2014-04-24 17:26  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a small fix to the Collada
	  loader which prevents a null pointer access in some cases."

2014-04-24 17:23  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "In the ::apply method, when the image data
	  need to be re-uploaded, the Texture2DArray checks if the
	  TextureObject can be re-used. The test was made using the
	  constant 1 instead of the real texture depth, so the
	  TextureObject was never re-used."

2014-04-24 17:14  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, "I and my team have gone over the code
	  again, and we feel that we are comfortable in our current
	  proposal for change. It goes deeper than it did before, and I
	  explain why:
	  
	  There was code in the osgViewer/Viewer.cpp and
	  osgViewer/CompositeViewer.cpp that transformed the Y-coordinates
	  of an event. The code in the composite viewer did however miss
	  the touch-data of the event. I thought that it should really be
	  the GUIEventAdapter that should know about this, and hence I
	  added the
	  GUIEventAdapter::setMouseYOrientationAndUpdateCoords which is
	  re-computing the coordinates. First I simply added a boolean to
	  the setMouseYOrientation function:
	  
	  setMouseYOrientation( MouseYOrientation, bool updatecooreds=false
	  );
	  
	  but then the serializer complained.
	  
	  This function is called from both the Viewer and the
	  CompositeViewer. We have not tested from the viewer, but I cannot
	  see it would not work from visual inspection.
	  
	  The other change is in
	  MultiTouchTrackballManipulator::handleMultiTouchDrag. I have
	  removed the normalisation. The reason for that is that it
	  normalised into screen coordinates from 0,0 to 1,1. The problem
	  with that is that if you have a pinch event and you keep the
	  distance say 300 pixels between your fingers, these 300 pixels
	  represent 0.20 of the screen in the horizontal domain, but 0.3 of
	  the screen in the vertical domain. A rotation of the
	  pinch-fingers will hence result in a zoom in, as the normalised
	  distance is changing between them.
	  
	  A consequence of this is that I have changed the pan-code to use
	  the same algorithm as the middle-mouse-pan.
	  
	  The rest of it is very similar from previous revision, and there
	  has been some fine-tuning here and there.
	  
	  "

2014-04-24 10:49  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Seems I was only half right given what you
	  asked for. CMP0017 only
	  says that modules that are found and ran from cmake modules dir
	  should
	  prefer cmake-provided modules. find_package() and include() still
	  look
	  in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH first.
	  
	  After some investigating I've come up with a proposal examplified
	  in
	  the attached FindGDAL.cmake script. It simply calls the cmake
	  provided
	  FindGDAL.cmake if it exists and returns if it succeeds in finding
	  GDAL
	  using that, otherwise continue with our local cmake code.
	  Pro: Wont clutter our root CMakeLists.txt
	  Con: If we begin to write more advanced Findxxx modules (using
	  COMPONENTS, REQUIRED etc.) we may have to revise this scheme.

2014-04-24 10:38  robert

	* Fixed reference invalidation bug.

2014-04-24 07:22  robert

	* Fixed typo in OPENSCENEGRAPH_OPENGL_HEADER name

2014-04-24 07:20  robert

	* Removed header as this CMake generated configuration file is not
	  required to be part of svn repository

2014-04-23 19:30  robert

	* Added src/osg/OpenGL.in configuration file and include/osg/OpenGL
	  header files

2014-04-23 09:08  robert

	* Introduced new scheme for setting up which version of
	  OpenGL/OpenGL ES the OSG is compiled for.
	  
	  To select standard OpenGL 1/2 build with full backwards and
	  forwards comtability use:
	  
	  ./configure
	  make
	  
	  OR
	  
	  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL2
	  
	  To select OpenGL 3 core profile build using GL3/gl3.h header:
	  
	  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL3
	  
	  To select OpenGL Arb core profile build using GL/glcorearb.h
	  header:
	  
	  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLCORE
	  
	  To select OpenGL ES 1.1 profile use:
	  
	  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLES1
	  
	  To select OpenGL ES 2 profile use:
	  
	  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLES2
	  
	  
	  Using OPENGL_PROFILE will select all the appropriate features
	  required so no other settings in cmake will need to be adjusted.
	  The new configuration options are stored in the
	  include/osg/OpenGL header that deprecates the old include/osg/GL
	  header.

2014-04-14 16:16  robert

	* Fixed comment

2014-04-13 16:04  robert

	* Renamed FindFreeType.cmake to FindFreetype.cmake to enable CMake

2014-04-09 17:40  robert

	* From Paul Cheyrou-Lagreze, "Attached is fix/feature for FBX
	  osgplugins against latest trunk:
	  
	  - ReaderWriterFBX.cpp: add "z up scene axis" support: FBX
	  provides facility to convert model scene axis during conversion.
	  Currently fbx plugin convert axis to fbx:opengl axis system
	  (which is arbitrarily at Y up, as opengl is in reality axis
	  agnostic) and sometimes what is needed is Z up so added an option
	  for Z up conversion
	  
	  - FindFBX.cmake: add support for latest fbx sdk ( 2014.2 )"

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "n the trunk version the

	  lineIntersection which use osgGA::GUIEventAdapter&, but the class
	  declaration is neither forwarded, nor is the header included.
	  Using the trunk together with osgEarth 2.5 will fail to build,

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "We had a small problem converting skeleton

2014-04-08 11:08  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, previous obj "commit broke compilation

2014-04-07 15:04  robert

	* Fixed build when using of double BoundingBox/BoundingSphere

2014-04-07 14:17  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am sending four fixes to obj plugin:
	  
	  - materialName used to be not stripped of whitespace, making
	  number of models
	  fail to load materials; now fixed
	  - stripping was considering spaces only, thus models using tabs
	  had problems
	  to load correctly; fixed
	  - fixed references to textures; they did not performed conversion
	  to native
	  directory separators
	  - make d (dissolve) takes precedence over Tr (transparency);
	  there seems to be
	  a confusion about the Tr item - some claiming 1 to be opaque and
	  0
	  transparent, while number of models uses exactly the opposite. d
	  (dissolve),
	  if present in the model, does not suffer from this confusion,
	  thus using it
	  instead fixes the problem for many many models.
	  
	  I put many comments to the file concerning d and Tr item as
	  others may further
	  investigate. Let me know in the case of any problems."

2014-04-07 14:11  robert

	* From Marcel Pursche, "The problem is that when OpenThreads is
	  build with the Linux pthreads implementation all threads inherit
	  the processor affinity from their parent thread.
	  This behavior is also described in the pthreads man page
	  (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html):
	  
	  >
	  > Linux-specific details
	  > The new thread inherits copies of the calling thread's
	  capability
	  > sets (see capabilities(7)) and CPU affinity mask (see
	  > sched_setaffinity(2)).
	  >
	  
	  To prevent this behaviour I wrote a patch that explicitly sets

	* From Bjorn Blessing, "I got bored of the constant reports of
	  “missing chunk 0xA08A” when reading 3ds-files. After a bit of
	  research I discovered that this property is related to the
	  advanced transparency settings for the material in 3D studio. In
	  this case the falloff parameter. These controls affect the
	  opacity falloff of a transparent material. And the property
	  chooses whether falloff is in or out. I have added the property
	  to the file reader BUT no changes are made to make this property
	  propagate into the osgMaterial. But at least we get rid of this

	  osg/GL2Extensions was incorrectly defining GL_RED_SNORM and

	* Added support for animating volume hulls.

2014-03-13 14:02  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached is a fix for the rest-http-plugin
	  which should fix the font-issue reported by Phil. The old
	  implementation did forward all requests to the internal
	  http-server via user-events. This prevented error-reporting for
	  missing files, as the request was accidentally handled by the
	  plugin. As a request for missing font-file succeeds and returned
	  an empty file, the curl-plugin hands the data happily to the
	  freetype-plugin which failed trying to load an empty font-file,
	  obviously.
	  
	  My fix was to rename the standard request handler to a
	  specialized user-event-handler which handles only requests for
	  "/user-event“
	  
	  So fonts should work on iOS when loaded remotely, even when a
	  local file is available and with the resthttp-plugin serving the
	  presentation.

	  existing Object with the specified propertyName.

2014-02-11 18:07  robert

	* Improved support for setting/getting properties via the
	  osg::UserDataContainer.

2014-02-11 10:56  robert

2014-02-06 17:04  robert

	* Added osg::CallbackObject suport to the experiment Widget base
	  class to enable script language extension of widgets

2014-02-05 11:08  robert

	* Tweaked the detection of when the position transform for the hull
	  is required.

2014-02-05 11:07  robert

	* Added support for a <hull> tag that can be used within <volume>
	  tag.

2014-02-05 11:04  robert

	* Improved the white space trimming

2014-02-04 16:49  robert

	* Added lua-5.2.3 as source code so it can be optinally built as
	  part of the lua plugin, making it possible to work out of the box
	  across all platforms with needing lua as an external dependency.
	  
	  Added the Cmake option OSG_USE_LOCAL_LUA_SOURCE to control
	  whether to build and use the Lua source code in the lua plugin,
	  or look for lua as an external dependency.

	* Replaced C cast to long with a static_cast<const void*>() to
	  avoid a build error under Mingw 64.

2014-01-31 16:20  robert

	* Added osg::CallbackObject to be used to extend C++ class from
	  scripting languages by providing callback objects assigned to the
	  osg::Object UserDataContainer, with the CallbackObject's Name
	  used to map the "method" provided by the CallbackObject. The
	  CallbackObject is implemented by the script engine to provide the
	  neccessary glue to invoking the script with the appropriate input
	  parameters and handling the output parameters.
	  
	  To the Lua plugin added support for assigned lua functions to C++
	  osg::Objects via the new osg::CallbackObject mechanism. To invoke
	  the scripts function from C++ one must get the CallbackObject and
	  call run on it.
	  
	  Renamed ScriptCallback to ScriptNodeCallback to avoid possibly
	  confusion between osg::CallbackObject and the ScriptNodeCallback.

2014-01-29 11:01  robert

2014-01-28 15:28  robert

	* Removed the invocation of gcc on all platforms

2014-01-28 11:01  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, "the vertical bar is upside down, and
	  hence not as the documentation says it should be. This is
	  corrected with this patch"
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed the example so that the vertical and
	  horizon scalar bars are rotated to the XZ plane so you can see
	  them with the default viewer's camera orientation.
	  Tweaked the positioning of title text of vertic scalar bar to
	  avoid overlap of text.

2014-01-27 15:43  robert

	* Removed unimplemented method

2014-01-24 17:31  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I experienced a crash in
	  Geometry::fixDeprecatedData(), on certain files, and brought the
	  problem down to a very simple test file, attached as test3.zip.
	  
	  There are two problems:
	  1> for DrawElementsUShortPrimitiveType (and UInt) the
	  source_pindex still equals -1 and causes a crash
	  in DrawElementsUBytePrimitiveType source_pindex is incremented,
	  and in DrawElementsU(Short/Int)PrimitiveType primitiveNum is
	  incremented, but never used
	  
	  2> The drawelements need to be rewritten as the vertices are
	  reordered.
	  
	  created a patch for osg stable branch(r14038): attached as
	  Geometry-osg-3.2.zip
	  and for svn brach(r14044): attached as Geometry_osg_svn.zip"

2014-01-24 17:06  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "In the "apply" method of
	  osg::FrameBufferObject, the draw buffers are always enabled, even
	  if the target is only "READ_FRAMEBUFFER".
	  
	  This can lead to inconsistency if you bind a framebuffer with
	  multiple attachments in DRAW mode and then a framebuffer with
	  different attachment count in READ mode (for example to manually
	  "blit" from a FBo to another).
	  
	  On some ATI cards (at least RADEON HD) this also leads to an
	  "incomplete " FBO status
	  
	  I've added a test to enable drawbuffers only if target is "DRAW"
	  or "READ_DRAW", this solves my problems on ATI cards."

2014-01-24 16:45  robert

	* From Michael Schanne, "small fix for a duplicate OR operand in
	  KdTree.cpp."

2014-01-24 16:28  robert

	* From Torben Dannahuer, "modified findcollada.cmake which can now
	  detect Boost 1.55 libraries, which are used by Collada in my
	  3rdParty package"

2014-01-24 16:24  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, VisualStudio 2013 build fixes

2014-01-24 16:19  robert

	* From Kristofer, "The osgSim::ScalarBar has a problem in that if
	  the scalarbar has a color in one end that co-incides with the
	  background color, one cannot see where the scalarbar ends. With
	  this patch, we add a line around the perimiter of the bar to mark
	  it.
	  
	  Secondly, we thought the text-annotation missed ticks that mark
	  out precisely where on the bar the texts relate to, so we added
	  that as well."

2014-01-24 16:01  robert

	* From Marc Helbling, "I am sending a small fix in the PLY
	  pseudo-loader; the extension was checked in plyfile.cpp thus
	  preventing the loading of any .PLY file (extension in uppercase).
	  The extension filtering is already handled by
	  ReaderWriter::acceptsExtension in a case unsensitive way."

2014-01-24 15:40  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2014-01-24 14:26  robert

	* Changed the handling of single window configurations so that
	  simply reuse the View::getCamera() instead of creating a slave.

2014-01-24 12:01  robert

	* Added a getModeUsage() method that prevents any mode being
	  automatically associated with these Texture types that are only
	  usable using non fixed function pipeline.

2014-01-24 11:37  robert

	* Fixed crash when reading a viewer configuration file where the
	  EventVisitor was being re-assigned but left a dangling pointer

2014-01-24 10:10  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached is a new zip containing two small
	  fixes:
	  * forwarded touch-events do have a correct input-range from 0 ..
	  1
	  * I refactored sending touch-events per osc so the receiver can
	  detect a TOUCH_ENDED better"

2014-01-23 19:55  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2014-01-23 16:48  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl,"we have a bunch of classes that inherit
	  osg::Node, and they create their own, internal geometry which is
	  passed into the render bucket at the cull-traversal. Last week,
	  we realised that these classes are not accounted for when doing
	  an ComputeBoundVisitor- traversal, as there is no specialization
	  in ComputeBoundVisitor for them.
	  
	  One solution is naturally to create a new class that would
	  inherit the osg::ComputeBoundVisitor, and use that. I don't like
	  that idea as the ComputeBoundVisitor does actually have what I
	  need - it is only hidden in a protected function.
	  
	  I am therefor suggesting a slight generalization of the
	  ComputeBoundVisitor with the attached patch, which is tested.
	  
	  The patch has two parts:
	  we add applyBBox() so that one can use that in a customized
	  traverse-function and add a bbox to the visitor. I considered
	  calling this function expandByBBox(), but I though applyBBox was
	  better.
	  The MatrixStack is made available to the outside world. That
	  enables a traverse-function to do whatever it wishes.
	  I do actually only need one of the two, as I can implement what I
	  wish either way, but adding getMatrixStack() will make more
	  generic expansions possible.
	  "
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed the name of the new applyBBox(..)
	  method to applyBoundingBox(..) to keep it's naming more
	  consistent with the rest of the OSG.

2014-01-23 15:37  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached are some fixes to the osc-plugin
	  and the touch-implementations for iOS and os x and other small
	  bugfixes. These fixes will normalize the orientation of the touch
	  points, and transmitting the touch points over osc via the
	  TUIO-protocol works now more robustly between two
	  osg-applications.
	  
	  I added a new tag to p3d called forward_touch_event_to_device and
	  renamed the existing forward_event_to_device to
	  forward_mouse_event_to_device. This new tag will transmit touches
	  to the virtual trackpad as touch events. I added the
	  MultitouchTrackball to the p3d-app so zooming and moving a model
	  remotely should now work, if you use
	  forward_touch_event_to_device. I kept (and fixed)
	  forward_mouse_event_to_device for background compatibility, so
	  old presentations works as in previous versions, without the
	  ability to zoom + scale. of course.
	  
	  forward_touch_event_to_device needs some more testing, (e.g. with
	  image-streams and keystone, afaik there’s no support for
	  touch-events...) but for a first version it works nice.
	  "

2014-01-23 10:56  robert

	* Removed debug message

2014-01-23 10:50  robert

	  threading model to SingleThreaded when using Qt5 to avoid crash
	  due to regresssion since Qt4.

2014-01-23 09:41  robert

	* Added clean up of osg::Program that are applied by the
	  GLObjectsVisitor, which addresses a state leak that creates GL
	  error once the main scene graph is rendered.

2014-01-23 07:59  robert

	* Added GL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE to texture mode list.

2014-01-22 17:29  robert

	* Made protected methods virtual to allow subclassing to customize
	  more aspects of the window setup.

2014-01-22 16:29  robert

	* Refactored .p3d loader to make it less strict about the tag,
	  property and value strings when matching them to supported
	  values.
	  
	  Examples of supported matches are:
	  
	  <Slide> and <slide> will be treated the same
	  <bgcolor>WHITE</bgcolor> and <bgcolor>White</bgcolor> will be
	  treated the same
	  <text alignment="TOP_LEFT"</text> and <text alignment="top
	  left"</text>, <text alignment="TopLeft"</text> will all be
	  treated the same

	  OpenSceneGraph-Data

2014-01-20 17:03  robert

	* Changed the default directory for the output files to be the
	  current working directory,
	  with the --write-to-source-file-directory added to allow one to

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, reimplement of AntiSquish node to avoid
	  the use of an update callback.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, small ammendments to clean up header.

	* From Roni Zanolli,Added use of Qt's new devicePixelRatio() method
	  to assist with handling the upscalling of resolution on iPhone
	  for "retina" displays.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed Roni's code to use a #define
	  GETDEVICEPIXELRATIO to access the versioned Qt devicePixelRatio()
	  method to avoid duplication of the Qt version checking.

2014-01-17 18:20  robert

	* Fixed warning

2014-01-17 18:20  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, fix for OSX build issue

2014-01-17 14:02  robert

	* From Kristoger Tingdahl, "the patch I sent to
	  src/osgQt/CMakeModules.txt did not do the work on windows. I have
	  fixed that, and also made it more generic so there is no special
	  handling of qt5.2, but all qt5 are the same.
	  
	  I have tested this on:
	  
	  mac/qt5.2
	  linux/qt5.2
	  windows/qt5.2, and
	  mac/qt5.1
	  
	  All platforms perform as expected.
	  
	  The previous fix removed the -f flag to the moc-pre-processor,
	  but on windows, it turned out that -f "osgQt/QGraphicsViewer" was
	  needed.
	  
	  This becomes an include-statement in the file generated by moc
	  which is needed for compiling it. I ask you consider this patch
	  for the trunk and the 3.2 branch.
	  
	  
	  Secondly, I wonder if it would be possible to apply my patch for
	  FindRSVG.cmake from 22nd November in the 3.2 branch.
	  
	  In short, the version of librsvg must be equal or higher to 2.35:
	  
	  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(RSVG librsvg-2.0>=2.35)
	  "

2014-01-17 13:59  robert

	* From Jordi Torres, "We have a code using gcc with -Wextra flag
	  and using OSG as a third party library. It does not compile when
	  importing <osgViewer/Viewer> failing in EventHandler and
	  GUIEventHandler:

	  /include/osgGA/GUIEventHandler:56:9: error: base class 'class

	  In case A is not initialized in the copy constructor of derived

	  I've added osg::Object to the initalization list of EventHandler

2014-01-07 16:18  robert

	* Bumped SO_VERSION number of OpenThreads to avoid conflicts with
	  Debian SO_VERSION bump

2014-01-07 16:15  robert

2013-12-19 17:13  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, "the syntax of the moc executable has
	  changed between 5.1.1 and 5.2.0 versions of qt (see below). The
	  difference is that the <file> argument has become mandatory after
	  the -f option.
	  
	  Hence, moc will complain when osg throws in a -f without anything
	  after it. Hence I propose removing the -f on Qt5 builds. I have
	  tested building without -f on both qt520 and qt511, and that
	  works well.
	  
	  The attached src/osgQt/CMakeLists.txt that can be patched into
	  3.2 safely. For the trunk, I would consider dropping the check on
	  the version, and simply remove the option on qt5. I have tested
	  that on qt5.1.1, and that worked fine. Question is however if it
	  works on qt5.0. Probably it does, so the question is simplicity
	  of CMakeList.txt vs safety."

2013-12-19 15:10  robert

	* From Sylvain Marie, When compiling OSG for the iOS simulator,
	  providing both -miphoneos-version-min and
	  -mios-simulator-version-min doesn’t please clang (tested on OS X
	  10.9.0 with Xcode 5.0.1).
	  Here is a small change (against commit
	  da597ab16945c572a2ad2f4f26fcef38ed21b074) in the CMakeLists.txt
	  to avoid this situation.

2013-12-19 13:53  robert

2013-12-19 13:49  robert

	* From Stephan Hunber, "attached you’ll find some changes to
	  osg/p3d:
	  
	  * a new command-line-option to present3d and a new option to the
	  p3d-plugin to suppress any found <env> tags
	  * a new command-line-option to present3d to forward mouse-events
	  via osgGA::Device (defaults to off) so we can test the
	  interface-files with present3d better
	  * I added a new attribute forward_to_devices for click_to_event
	  to forward the event to all attached devices instead of handling
	  the event locally. This will fix the annoyance with the new
	  interface-files when toggling polygon-mode or switching light
	  on/off.
	  
	  Here’s an example:
	  
	  <click_to_event forward_to_devices="true">0x72</click_to_event>

2013-12-19 13:44  robert

	* From Stephan Hunber, "I found some time and ported
	  osgDB::FileUtils and DarwinUtils across new apis to fix the
	  warnings about deprecated api-usage.
	  
	  * osgDB::FileUtils uses now the Cocoa-API to determine the paths
	  of the application-support-folder
	  * DarwinUtils uses now modern functions of the quartz-api to get
	  and set screen-resolutions. Removed some of the osg-deprecated
	  stuff.

	* From Stephan Huber, "CLang / LLVM on OS X seems to have a problem
	  compiling the osgGA-serializer. (It was reported before on the
	  list, but the error is hard to track as it shows up only
	  sometimes)
	  
	  I fixed the compile-error with a dedicated destructor of
	  osgGA::GUIEventHandler"

2013-11-21 14:08  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, " recently encountered an issue attempting
	  to load an IVE file generated by an older version of OSG. The
	  file contained dxt1 compressed image data with mipmaps. The
	  loaded model would cause crashes when passing the mipmap data to
	  glCompressedTexImage2D. It seems that the size of the data array
	  within the IVE file did not match the computed size from
	  Image::getTotalSizeInBytesIncludingMipmaps(). This essentially
	  made the mipmap offsets invalid within the Image object.
	  
	  I'm not sure if the IVE was simply generated incorrectly, or if
	  the Image::getTotalSizeInBytesIncludingMipmaps() was modified
	  since the file was generated. Either way, I added a simple check
	  in the IVE loader so that it clears the mipmap offsets if the
	  actual data size does not match the computed data size. This
	  seems like a safe fallback since the mipmap data can be
	  automatically generated, and it fixes the problem in my case.
	  
	  Also, while looking into this issue, I noticed that the
	  osgDB::InputStream class applies the serialized image allocation
	  mode. However, since the serializer is allocating the image data
	  itself, it seems like it should force the allocation mode to
	  USE_NEW_DELETE.

	* From Colin McDonald, "The osgt/osgb file formats output a
	  scenegraph node with the type
	  set to "SCENE" in the file header. But if the file is stored and
	  then extracted again from an osga archive this header info is
	  lost,
	  and the resulting file is just an "OBJECT". Possibly other plugin
	  operations would have the same effect. The osgt/osgb plugin won't
	  then return the scenegraph contents.
	  
	  I have updated the osgt/osgb plugin to return a node from an
	  "OBJECT"
	  file."

2013-10-22 11:26  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The osgb file reader uses seek to position
	  within the file.
	  But the nested stream implementation for osga archive files
	  doesn't
	  support seeking. So osgb files can't currently be used in an osga
	  archive e.g. if osgdem is used to output a osgb format database
	  it
	  can't be packaged in an archive file, in the same manner that ive
	  files could.
	  
	  I've added seek support to the osga nested stream
	  implementation."

2013-10-22 11:18  robert

	* Fixed handling of osg::Program so that it's not overriden by
	  shader composition when enabled

2013-10-18 07:31  robert

	* From Andreas Henne, "in my application I use the
	  TrackballDragger, the ScaleAxisDragger and the
	  TranslateAxisDragger. Unfortunately these draggers are very thin
	  and they do not provide methods to change their visual
	  appearance. Another problem that I noticed is that lighting on
	  the cones and boxes of the TranslateAxisDragger and
	  ScaleAxisDragger is incorrect when the draggers are scaled due to
	  not normalized normals. This small patch adresses these problems,
	  providing methods to make the draggers thicker. I have attached a
	  zip archive containing the corresponding files and also a
	  modified osgManipulator example that makes use of the
	  modifications. I don't want to retain any copyright."

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "With the new osg::Geometry the binding for
	  arrays now default to undefined. This breaks previously working
	  code in osgAnimation::RigTransformHardware where the arrays got
	  an undefined bounding and because of this the bone indices and

	  the existing logic)
	  * removed unnecessary warning-flagss when generating
	  xcode-projects via cmake, will enable the usage of
	  OSG_AGGRESSIVE_WARNING_FLAGS
	  * added support for 10.9 (OS X)
	  * new cmake-variable: IPHONE_VERSION_MIN, this will set the
	  deployment-target (previously hard-coded) If you set the
	  IPHONE_VERSION_MIN to something like 7.0 osg gets compiled also
	  for 64bit (amd64)
	  * cmake defaults now to the clang compiler if IPHONE_VERSION_MIN
	  > 4.2
	  * cmake now sets some xcode-settings so the compiler uses the
	  c++98-standard (clang defaults to c++11, w/o this I got a lot of
	  linking errors)
	  * removed include-dir for avfoundation-plugin as not needed on
	  OSX/IOS.
	  * enhanced the ios-example, will now show multitouch-information
	  on a hud (similar to the osgmultitouch-example), and more

	  for MOVE/DRAG, even if multiple msgs/event is enabled)
	  * better memory-handling for the zeroconf-plugin
	  * fixed a possible bug in the rest-http-plugin when receiving
	  mouse-events.

2013-10-02 13:59  robert

	* From Colin McDonald and Robert Osfield, "When a serializer shared
	  library is loaded it registers all of
	  the wrappers it contains. The registration creates a prototype
	  object for all of the wrapped classes. For some of the
	  higher-level
	  classes this can be a bit heavy.
	  
	  I noticed a problem with a model which required a single class
	  from
	  osgSim. When osgdb_serializers_osgsim.so was loaded it registered
	  wrappers and created prototype objects for all of the osgSim
	  classes,
	  including osgSim::ScalarBar. The constructor for that class
	  creates
	  several drawables, and loads arial.ttf using the freetype plugin.
	  I
	  don't need that, and don't even ship the font or plugin with my
	  application, resulting in an unexplained warning message loading
	  the model.
	  
	  I've modified the ObjectWrapper class to defer the prototype
	  object
	  creation until if & when actually required."

	* From Dmitry Marakasov, "These are FreeBSD bits for
	  src/osgPlugins/osc/osc/OscHostEndianness.h,
	  required to build newever OSG on this OS. Also corrects file name
	  in the error message - I was confused not to find
	  OSCHostEndianness.h

	  Tested by successfully building OSG 3.2.0 with this patch on
	  FreeBSD
	  9.1."

	* From Björn Hein, "it seems that for generating "per vertex

2013-10-01 19:00  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog in prep for dev release

2013-10-01 17:01  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "I'm working with OSG and a customer
	  low-level OpenGL library.
	  
	  To make easier "lazy apply" on the customer OpenGL shaders, the
	  easiest way was to add an accessor to current OSG state's
	  UniformMap.
	  
	  I've also added accessors for modes and texture, since it could
	  be usefull in the same way.
	  
	  All methods are const, so I think there is no side-effects."

2013-10-01 16:20  robert

	* From Björn Blissing, "I propose making the following outputs a
	  little bit more silent. In my mind it would suffice with
	  OSG_DEBUG (compared to OSG_NOTICE) for these information
	  messages."

2013-10-01 09:37  robert

	* From Christopher Baker, submitted by Alberto Luacas, "there is a
	  bug report in the Ubuntu tracker that points to a bug when
	  loading multiple VRML files in parallel. Christopher R. Baker has
	  detected this bug and crafted a patch. In addition, libcoin has
	  to be
	  also built with the "--enable-threadsafe" option.
	  
	  I copy here his report, extracted from
	  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openscenegraph/+bug/1211993)
	  and attach his fix. All credit is due to him:
	  
	  «
	  There are three instances of a classical method-local-static
	  multithreaded initialization bug in the Inventor plugin for OSG
	  that
	  trigger various memory faults when reading multiple VRML files in
	  parallel via osgDB::readNodeFile. These bugs are of the form:
	  
	  static std::map<Stuff,OtherStuff> myHandyMap;
	  static bool once = true;
	  if(once) { ...fill myHandyMap; once = false }
	  ... use myHandyMap;
	  
	  To repeat: try loading multiple VRML files from multiple threads.
	  The
	  liklihood of the bug depends on many factors, but my application,
	  which
	  parallel-loads some dozens of small (<100K) VRML files on
	  startup,
	  triggers this problem 25% of the time or more.
	  
	  The attached patch (inventor-plugin-multithread.patch) rectifies
	  this
	  problem by:
	  
	  1 - Inheriting MyHandyMap from std::map, then
	  2 - Moving the map initialization into the derived constructor,
	  which
	  3 - Is intrinsically protected from multithread issues by g++
	  (and is
	  part of the C++ standard), unless you pass
	  -fno-threadsafe-statics,
	  which is strongly discouraged by the man page.

2013-10-01 09:11  robert

	* From Adrien Grandemange, "On Windows 7 and 8, mouse messages are
	  generated in addition to touch messages, which leads to duplicate
	  PUSH, DRAG and RELEASE events in OSG. Besides, the mouse and
	  touch messages referring to the same user input are not
	  necessarily sent at the same time, due to gesture translation
	  done by Windows by default, such as double-tap => double-click
	  and long-push => right-click.
	  The delay between the 2 types of messages is more noticeable on
	  Windows 8 and leads to serious disruptions in our application.
	  
	  Mouse messages generated by touch input are only present for
	  legacy support. I think they should be filtered out by OSG (real
	  click events originating from a physical mouse will of course
	  still go through).
	  
	  This is what this patch does, according to this suggestion:
	  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd693088%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
	  (third issue in this page)."

2013-10-01 09:05  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth, "Attached is a small build fix for
	  PointSprite when compiling under GLES2 (r13788)
	  
	  GL_POINT_SPRITE_OES does not exist in GLES2, instead you just
	  draw using GL_POINTS then use gl_PointSize in a vertex shader to
	  set the size."

2013-09-30 18:32  robert

	* From Jeffrey Kinross, "I ran into an issue with case sensitivity
	  on OS X and the OSXAVFoundation code.
	  In CMakeList.txt there is a case sensitivity issue which a fix
	  was posted by Robert Osfield in the users forum.
	  
	  I also had to rename the files OSXAvFoundationCoreVideoTexture.h
	  and OSXAvFoundationCoreVideoTexture.cpp to
	  OSXAVFoundationCoreVideoTexture.h and
	  OSXAVFoundationCoreVideoTexture.cpp
	  
	  Finally in OSXAvFoundationCoreVideoTexture.cpp the include
	  OSXAVFoundationVideo.H was updated to OSXAVFoundationVideo.h"

2013-09-30 18:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I have a scene that makes heavy use of
	  the StateSet::compare method and my profiler showed that a lot of
	  time was being spent inside it. I made a small change to the
	  method so that it performs a quick size comparison between the
	  attribute/mode lists and bin mode before iterating through all
	  the attributes. This made a noticeable improvement in my scene.
	  I've attached the change."

2013-09-30 10:28  robert

	* Added type maps to help with querrying supported type names

2013-09-19 16:19  robert

	* Introduce osgDB::PropetyInterface class that provided a generic
	  interface for get/setting properties on scene graph objects,
	  utilizing the osgDB serializers to do
	  the actual interface query and set/gets.

2013-09-19 16:18  robert

	  Added Vec*i and Vec*ui support to serializers

2013-09-10 15:17  robert

	* From Giuseppe Donvito, "I'm using OSG 320 and I need to flush a
	  DDS 3D texture on disk.
	  I found a bug on DDS ReaderWriter that generates a false positive
	  on a guard for the size check on writing operation. This is due
	  to a wrong imageSize computation that uses
	  img->getImageSizeInBytes() method instead of
	  img->getTotalSizeInBytes(), that actually ignores the r()
	  dimension, contrariwise taken into account by the function
	  ComputeImageSizeInBytes() later.
	  
	  The line 1062 on file ReaderWriterDDS.cpp should be fixed with:
	  [code]unsigned int imageSize = img->getTotalSizeInBytes();[/code]
	  "

2013-09-10 13:29  robert

	* From Giuseppe Donvito, Fixed typo of "CLEAR_GLOBAL_STATESET =

2013-09-10 09:23  robert

	* Added osgPresentation::Show node and implementations with basic
	  property reporting for various internal nodes of presentation
	  graph

2013-09-09 16:02  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The Python header will look for its libraries
	  using "#pragma comment(lib,"python32_d.lib")" for MSVC. So
	  user-specified libraries will not really be set for the
	  osgdb_python plugin. This small fix may help locate the Python
	  libraries after putting the CMakeLists.txt into
	  src/osgPlugins/python
	  
	  "

2013-09-09 14:58  robert

	* From Colin Cochran, OES support for point sprites

2013-09-09 13:33  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Add test for GL_EXT_framebuffer_object
	  extension : osg uses osg::FBOExtensions to check if Frame Buffer
	  Objects are
	  available. But this just checks if the fbo functions can be
	  called.
	  It doesn't check if the OpenGL renderer supports fbos. For
	  indirect
	  rendering on linux the client side capability may be different
	  from
	  the display server, which can lead to mipmapped textures failing
	  to
	  render. I've added a fbo extension check.
	  "

2013-09-09 12:44  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "Patch for FindAVFoundation to work with OS
	  X 10.9"

2013-09-09 12:37  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Some developers report that the osgviewerMFC
	  example is broken in 3.2, in which depth test is not enabled by
	  default so all models loaded look awkward. I submit this patch to
	  make it work again. I haven't gone deep to check why previous
	  example goes wrong in newer version but I believe the problem was
	  because the newly created camera object missed some important
	  global statesets before set as the main camera."

2013-09-09 12:33  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "two minor fixes, both in a CMakeList.txt
	  file,
	  
	  1> osgmultiplemovies example does not use SDL so needs no link to
	  SDL
	  
	  2> Added header files to "Plugins osg" project, so visual studio
	  can find the source of
	  OSG_WARN << "AsciiInputIterator::readProperty(): Unmatched
	  property "
	  "

2013-09-06 09:35  robert

	* Initial cut of Audio/Volume/Movie/Image presentation objects

2013-09-05 10:23  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Attached are some fixes to build osg using
	  the Solaris Studio compiler.
	  I've also checked the modified files still build ok with other
	  compilers (Linux gcc, Windows Visual Studio).
	  
	  osgDB/OutputStream.cpp and osgPlugins/lws/SceneLoader.cpp require
	  stdlib.h for atoi use.
	  
	  In osg/Uniform.cpp the compiler complains that base_class is
	  unknown
	  unless I add a class name qualifier.
	  
	  Not a build fix, but I spotted a typo in osgUtil/SceneView."

2013-09-05 10:08  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "like the "Bug in ProxyNode serializer"
	  Farshid Lashkari found (svn submit 13754) the PagedLOD serializer
	  attempts to read begin and and brackets.
	  Fix is identical (don't read brackets when num_chidren is zero)
	  and applies both to trunk and 3.2 branch."

2013-09-05 10:04  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2013-09-05 08:42  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "current versions of ffmpeg render
	  «url_feof» macro as obsolete. The fix
	  is very simple and it is contained in the attached file."

2013-09-05 08:22  robert

	* Added missing Model.cpp

2013-09-04 17:27  robert

2013-09-03 10:17  robert

	* Added beginings of Text implementation

2013-09-02 10:56  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The ProxyNode serializer was not
	  correctly reading the "Children" field. It conditionally writes
	  the begin/end brackets, depending on whether it has children.
	  However, during input it unconditionally attempts to read the
	  begin/end brackets. I've modified the code to only read the
	  brackets if it has children."

2013-09-02 10:56  robert

	* Refactored the use of epsilon in the clamping of the start/end
	  points of the LineSegmentIntersector to better handle numerical

	  clean up the main present3D source directory for future
	  refactored present3D

2013-08-09 16:51  robert

	* Added initial cut of basic scripting support, introducing an
	  osg::Script object to wrap up the individual scripts,
	  osg::ScriptCallback for assigning a Script as node callback and
	  an osg::ScriptEngine base class that plugins implement to
	  provided support for specific scripting languages.
	  
	  Provided are lua, python and V8 (for javascript) plugins that
	  just open up enough of a link to the respective libs to run a
	  script, there is no scene graph <-> script communication in
	  current implementation.

2013-08-09 11:00  robert

	* Removed CameraNode reference

2013-08-09 07:46  robert

2013-08-09 07:38  robert

	* Removed old cursor code

2013-08-08 17:21  robert

	* Added translucent version of cushion which isn't depth tested to
	  enable one to see the cursor even when it's behind other objects

2013-08-08 16:49  robert

	* Added osgPresentation::Cursor class to wrap up 3D cursor in the
	  scene functionality

2013-08-07 17:08  robert

	* Added osgpresentation example as a test bed for new
	  osgPresentation object model.
	  
	  First cut of example test bed is to test how easy it is to build
	  against Lua, V8 and Python for purposes of running embedded
	  scripts.

2013-08-05 12:00  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "I've go some problem with the method
	  "State_Utils::replace" : if the original_phrase is empty, it
	  leads to an infinite loop.
	  
	  Here is a path to prevent this."

2013-08-01 17:38  robert

	* Added missing initializer for _epsilon

2013-08-01 11:25  robert

	* From Anish Thomas, added catch for to an empty DrawElementsUInt
	  creation.

2013-08-01 10:38  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS file

2013-08-01 10:28  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "Based on the exchange on osg-users I went
	  ahead and reworked shp/XBaseParser to avoid
	  weird behaviour (closing stdin) and leaking file descriptors, as
	  well as some const-ness."

2013-08-01 10:04  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "Seems like your re-factoring
	  didn't really produces the correct results.
	  You can check with the tester2.flt provided earlier and check
	  with the result image.
	  I double checked this with OpenFlight creator, and it seems the
	  yaw is broken.
	  
	  With my initial quaternion version is seems correct and if I
	  change the
	  
	  
	  float cos_yaw = cosf(osg::inDegrees(yaw));
	  float sin_yaw = sinf(osg::inDegrees(yaw));
	  
	  to be
	  float cos_yaw = cosf(osg::inDegrees(-yaw));
	  float sin_yaw = sinf(osg::inDegrees(-yaw));
	  
	  it seems to work as well."

2013-08-01 10:00  robert

	* From Tom Jolley, "I found a couple more bugs after closely
	  looking at the small piece of deprecated geometry in my model.
	  There were problems with more than one primitive in a couple
	  places. The first was the number of vertices were not being
	  accumulated for DrawArraysPrimitiveType (caused another crash).
	  The second is I had to move target_vindex and source_pindex
	  before the PrimitiveSetList loop so they don't get reset on the
	  next primitive (otherwise you end up with a lot of zeros in per
	  vertex lists)."

2013-08-01 07:19  robert

	* Added osg::RenderInfo::pushRenderBin()/popRenderBin() and
	  RenderInfo::getRenderBinStack() and getCameraStack() access
	  methods for getting access to the current RenderBin/RenderStage.

2013-07-31 13:11  robert

	* Added Intersector::get/setEpsilon(double) to allow users to
	  control what epsilon is used by the LineSegmentIntersector when
	  doing testing of itersections with bounding boxes

2013-07-31 07:11  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "Here is the code to get access to OpenGL
	  handle of an osg::FrameBufferObject"

2013-07-31 06:56  robert

	* From Tom Jolly, "I ran across this error reading one of our older
	  files. An iterator was being changed inside a loop that caused a
	  crash."

2013-07-31 06:42  robert

	* From Sergey Kurdakov, fixed GLES2 invalid enumerant warning by
	  disabling the check against GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS under GLES.

2013-07-30 06:39  robert

	* Updated OpenThreads version

2013-07-19 21:05  robert

	* From Christian Ruzicka, "with the current touch implementation on
	  iOS the touches are not forwarded to parent views because the
	  base implementation is not called. Also see the "Best Practices"
	  in the iOS documentation for event handling:
	  
	  http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/multitouch_background/multitouch_background.html
	  
	  "If you handle events in a subclass of any other UIKit responder
	  class:
	  - You do not have to implement all of the event handling methods.
	  - In the methods you do implement, be sure to call the superclass
	  implementation. For example, [super touchesBegan:touches
	  withEvent:event]."
	  
	  I added the missing lines and tested it with OSG 3.1.9 and iOS
	  SDK 6.1."

2013-07-19 20:59  robert

	  like View does by default.

2013-07-19 06:56  robert

	* From Johannes Scholz, "as we need to dynamically add and remove
	  Effects to and from our Application, I created a small patch for
	  osgFX/Registry to add the osgFX::Registry::removeEffect(effect*)
	  method and extended osgFX::Registry::Proxy to call removeEffect

2013-07-19 06:39  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "A very small clerical error in the

2013-07-19 06:20  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "we found that events where not caught when

2013-07-18 16:29  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, "after being absent for more than 12
	  month, I'm very pleased to present my
	  new 3rdparty package (V8).
	  
	  This package is compiled with Visual Studio 2012 Update 3. Some
	  community
	  members complained that these package is very large (indeed), so
	  I
	  introduced 2 versions:
	  - The small version contains the dependencies for several image
	  file formats
	  ( tiff, png, gif, jpeg), as well as zlib, minizip, curl,
	  freetype, glut,
	  gdal and openSSL
	  - The full version will include all libraries which were include
	  in the
	  previous releases of my 3rd party package.
	  
	  Some of the included libraries are released in newer versions, so
	  I adapted
	  the attached CMake module to find these renamed files.
	  
	  I hope you can merge this minor changes soon, since I plan to
	  publish the
	  small 3rdparty package today.

	  Warning, can't assign attribute binding as no has been array
	  assigned to set binding for.
	  
	  I think those are ive's with bumpmaps, but I have not checked
	  yet. The problem is in
	  OpenSceneGraph\src\osgPlugins\ive\Geometry.cpp
	  where the code tries to set Normalize and Binding for a missing
	  Array.
	  I think that code can safely be skipped, considering the write
	  function has a hardcoded write when the array is missing.

2013-07-02 10:32  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "Recently I had to integrate a client
	  OpenGL library with OSG. For textures and other StateAttribute
	  I've done that by subclassing osg::StateAttribute and this works
	  well.
	  
	  But for glPrograms, in order to get all osg's uniform management

	  osg::program::PerContextProgram.
	  
	  Here is a modified version of this class, which add some
	  "virtual" method to allow easy subclassing."

2013-07-02 09:44  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "The binding of arrays is always set to
	  BIND_UNDEFINED when using the array constructor because the
	  binding parameter is ignored. Here is a fix."

2013-07-02 09:27  robert

	* Added SceneView::Options enum enetries APPLY_GLOBAL_DEFAULTS and
	  CLEAR_GLOBAL_STATESET to control whether a
	  _globalStateSet->clear() and _globalStateSet->setGlobalDefaults()
	  should be called.
	  
	  osgViewer::Renderer doesn't use these enum settings so now no
	  longer has a calls StateSet::clear() or
	  StateSet::setGlobalDefaults() on the osg::Camera's StateSet.
	  Previously these were being
	  called and breaking the ability to attached state to Camera's
	  StateSet.

2013-07-01 16:15  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "In a submission on June 27th a lot of new
	  array types were added. This modified the osg::Array::Type enum.
	  Because of this s_ArrayNames array in Array.cpp is now not in
	  sync. This can lead to corrupt exports or crashes when writing
	  .osg files because the change added new types in the middle of
	  the enum instead of at the end.
	  
	  Attached is a new Array.cpp to reflect the new array types."

2013-07-01 12:16  robert

	* Fixed debug build compile problem

2013-07-01 08:21  robert

	* Reverted the usage of OSG_UNUSED and OT_UNUSED as in hindsight
	  these should never have been merged. Adding code to quieten
	  inappropriate warnings is a bad programming practice and does not
	  desrve a place in the OSG code base.

2013-06-28 15:44  robert

	* From John Kaniarz, "This patch modifies ReaderWriterPNG.cpp to
	  1. Check the bit depth of the passed Image and return an error if

	* Fixed handling of DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:2 usage.

2013-06-28 13:43  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, Added support for glPrimitiveRestartIndex.
	  
	  "The idea of this new OpenGL feature is :
	  
	  - set RestartIndex = "n"
	  - draw elements strip
	  -> when the index is "n", the strip is "stopped" and restarted
	  
	  It's very usefull for drawing tiles with a single strip and a
	  "restart" at the end of each row.
	  
	  The idea a an OSG StateAttribute is :
	  
	  Usually we use to build geometry from code, because software
	  modelers rarely support it (and 3d file formats doesn't support
	  it) :
	  
	  -RootNode <= "PrimitiveRestartIndex=0" // So now, we know that
	  our restart index is 0 for all drawables under this node
	  |
	  - Drawable 1 : triangles => as usual
	  |
	  - Drawable 2 : triangles strip => as usual
	  |
	  - Drawable 3 : triangles strip + "GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART" mode = ON
	  => use the restart index
	  |
	  - Drawable 4 : triangles strip + "GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART" mode = ON
	  => use the restart index
	  |
	  - Drawable 5 : triangles strip => as usual
	  
	  
	  With a StateAttribute, it's easy for the developper to say "0
	  will be my restart index for all this object" and then activate
	  the mode only on some nodes.
	  
	  The main problem is if you set and restart index value which is
	  not included in the vertex array (for exemple set restart index =
	  100 but you have only 50 vertex). There is no problem with
	  OpenGL, but some OSG algorithms will try to access the
	  vertex[100] and will segfault.
	  
	  To solve this, I think there is two ways :
	  
	  1/ add restart index in osg::PrimitiveSet and use this value in
	  all algorithms. It's a lot of work, maybe dangerous, and it
	  concern only a few situations : developpers who use this
	  extension should be aware of advanced OpenGL (and OSG) data
	  management
	  
	  2/ use a StateAttribute, and choose a "correct" restart index. In
	  my applications, I always use "0" as a restart index and
	  duplicate the first vertex (vertex[0] = vertex[1]). So there is
	  no difference for OpenGL and all OSG algorithms works properly.
	  "

2013-06-28 12:45  robert

	* Added handling of an odd number rows in the capsule rendering and

2013-06-26 13:00  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "This submission allow the user to specify
	  how to setup VertexAttributeAliasing.
	  
	  I think this is necessary on OpenGL 3.2+ since this is no more
	  "default" locations in the OpenGL specs.
	  
	  The default behaviour stay the same.
	  
	  There is a few new methods on osg::State :
	  
	  - resetVertexAttributeAlias : reset all vertex alias to osg's
	  default ones
	  - set**Alias : set a vertex attribute alias configuration
	  - setAttributeBindingList : set the attribute binding list (allow

2013-06-26 09:04  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov and Robert Osfield, "the index mesh and
	  vertex pre-transform optimizers can rearrange or change the size

	  Attached a fix that duplicates shared geometry arrays."

2013-06-26 08:53  robert

	* Removed Geometry::fixDeprecatedData() as it won't work on const
	  Geometry

2013-06-26 07:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "The attached file replaces the

	  The per primitive use is changed to full per vertex arrays."

2013-06-25 16:19  robert

	* Removed #include<osg/Notify> as it's nolonger required in the
	  header

2013-06-25 16:10  robert

	* With assistance from Sukender, moved the depreacted osg::Geometry
	  vertex indices and AttributeBinding definitions out into a
	  separated namespace/class so to use
	  deprecated features you should now use deprecated_osg::Geometry
	  in place of osg::Geometry.

2013-06-25 11:13  robert

	* From Christian Buchner, "Here is a strongly overhauled version of
	  the original osgoit ("order independent transparency") by Mathias
	  Fröhlich. I called this version myosgoit. It looks very nice,
	  just build and run it!
	  
	  This version adds:
	  
	  - an encapsulation of the entire Depth Peeling procedure into a
	  class (not currently a scene graph node) for easier integration
	  in other projects.
	  
	  - compositing with opaque (solid) geometry is possible and the
	  opaque model is only rendered once. This needs to performs some
	  depth buffer blitting between FBOs.
	  
	  - mix and match with GLSL shaders in the transparent objects is
	  possible, as demonstrated with a 3D heat map intersecting an
	  opaque truck model.
	  
	  
	  Some Drawbacks:
	  
	  - the display framebuffer does not receive any depth information
	  from the compositing camera. This could be fixed by compositing
	  with a GLSL shader and writing to FragDepth."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, ported the code to work under Linux and
	  without the automatic ref_ptr to C* conversion.

2013-06-25 09:52  robert

	* From Alberto Luacas, "current Doxygen warns against the use of
	  obsolete fields:

	  I have removed those in the configuration files."

2013-06-24 12:51  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "I fixed a little issue with the lightwave
	  scene loader. On the version 5 there are id on the command
	  LoadObjectLayer in the scene file and of this version the current
	  code use this field as a part of the filename, and it fails
	  because the file is not found.
	  I just added a field version_ to read it at the beginning and
	  added extra code to check it and read the extra field if needed
	  and read the good filename"

2013-06-24 12:31  robert

	* From Christian Ruzicka, "when MSAA is activated on iOS, the

	* From Lars Nillson, "The change in this submission is to take care

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a small patch that extends
	  the Image::readImageFromCurrentTexture method to support more
	  depth texture pixel formats (16, 24, 32, 32F). In order to
	  compile, I moved some depth pixel format definitions from
	  FrameBufferObject to Image.

2013-06-24 09:31  robert

	* From Christian Noon, "Got a simple patch for correcting a problem
	  with the USE_COMPRESSOR_WRAPPER() macro in the osgDB::Registry.
	  The problem is that the wrapper declaration doesn't match the one
	  defined in the REGISTER_COMPRESSOR() method in the
	  osgDB::ObjectWrapper method. This patch fixes the wrapper
	  declaration so they both match properly. I ran into this problem
	  using compressed files in an iOS application where all the
	  libraries and plugins need to be built statically."

2013-06-24 09:12  robert

	* From Nick Black, "Hey there! avcodec_open() has been deprecated
	  for some time, and indeed has
	  been removed in the most recent versions of libavcodec/ffmpeg.
	  You're
	  already using avcodec_open2() elsewhere, but one appears to have
	  been
	  missed. The change is trivial:

2013-06-24 09:02  robert

	* Introduced typedef's to make the code more readble and
	  maintanable

2013-06-24 08:48  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The file attached includes two new features for
	  the serialization IO functionality. First, custom serializer
	  version control should work now, just by defining a new
	  REGISTER_CUSTOM_OBJECT_WRAPPER macro. For example:
	  
	  // A custom class
	  namespace CustomDomain {
	  
	  class MyGroup : public osg::Group
	  {
	  public:
	  META_Node( CustomDomain, MyGroup );
	  
	  void setMyName( const std::string& n );
	  const std::string& getMyName() const;
	  
	  void setMyID( int id );
	  int getMyID() const;
	  
	  ...
	  };
	  
	  }
	  
	  // The serialization wrapper using a custom domain name
	  REGISTER_CUSTOM_OBJECT_WRAPPER( MyDomain,
	  CustomDomain_MyGroup,
	  new CustomDomain::MyGroup,
	  CustomDomain::MyGroup,
	  "osg::Object osg::Node osg::Group CustomDomain::MyGroup" )
	  {
	  ADD_STRING_SERIALIZER( MyName, std::string() );
	  {
	  UPDATE_TO_VERSION_SCOPED( 1 ); // Updated for a new domain
	  version
	  ADD_INT_SERIALIZER( MyID, 0 );
	  }
	  }
	  
	  Save the class instance as follows:
	  osgDB::writeNodeFile( *myGroup, "serializer_test.osgt", new
	  osgDB::Options("CustomDomains=MyDomain:1") );
	  
	  The output file will include the domain version definition and
	  all the class data, and can be read back. We can also force
	  setting the domain version by the CustomDomains option while
	  reading the saved files. If we save the class instance without
	  any options, MyID will be ignored because the default domain
	  version is 0.
	  
	  This may help third-party libraries like osgEarth to maintain
	  their own serializers without regarding to the OSG soversion
	  changes.
	  
	  Another feature added is a more robust binary format, which in
	  fact adds a size-offset at each block's beginning. When there are
	  problems or unsupported data types while reading, we can now
	  directly jump to the block end indicated by the offset value. So
	  a .osgb file will automatically ignore bad data and read remains
	  as normal (at present it will fail at all). This feature will not
	  break the backward compatibility, and can be disabled by setting
	  "RobustBinaryFormat=false" while writing out.
	  
	  Hope these changes can work smoothly with present and future
	  community projects. Maybe we should also consider have an
	  osgserializer example to test and demonstrate all things we can
	  do now."

2013-06-24 08:22  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Sorry for my very slow response because of some
	  personal issues. I found that new Geometry serializers can't work
	  with old .osgb files. The modified FastPathHint serializer
	  doesn't correctly read from the stream and thus jumbles following
	  inputs. The file attached can be placed in
	  osgWrappers/serializers/osg to fix that problem.
	  
	  "

2013-06-24 08:19  robert

	  VS compiler):

2013-06-24 08:18  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "In many game engines it is common to set
	  the W component of the tangent vector to -1 if the UVs are
	  mirrored and 1 if not. I've updated the
	  osgUtil::TangentSpaceGenerator class to do the same."

2013-06-21 09:17  robert

	* From FrancoisTigeot, "OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1 doesn't build out of
	  the box on DragonFly and needs
	  a few modifications to these files:
	  - applications/present3D/Cluster.cpp
	  - src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp
	  
	  The changes are needed to fix a few platform specific things such
	  as the
	  absence of stat64, int/socklen_t differences, etc... and are in
	  the same
	  line as Linux, Apple and FreeBSD specific checks.
	  
	  I have attached the modified files; the original patches to 3.0.1

	  DragonFly
	  whereas it previously failed to compile."

2013-06-21 08:56  robert

	* From Matthias Helsing, "Here is the changed source to prefer
	  using _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE but fall back to XRaiseWindow should
	  the Atoms not be supported. I'm not sure how many might be using
	  the raiseWindow feature but I needed it for a splash on Ubuntu
	  12.04."

2013-06-21 08:37  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've updated the dds, png, and jpeg
	  plugins to support writing images with the GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT
	  pixel format. They will simply treat it the same as the
	  GL_LUMINANCE pixel format."

2013-06-21 08:03  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, " I have put there in the comment a nicer way of
	  doing version
	  checks, but that needs at least CMake 2.6.2."

2013-06-20 16:44  robert

	* Fixed the handling the mouse min/max ranges of slave Cameras that
	  have a parent Camera with a viewport.

2013-06-20 15:48  robert

	* Temporarily commented out call to
	  view.assignStereoOrKeystoneToCamera() for implementing stereo as
	  this was causing problem in trackball manipulation

2013-06-20 15:18  robert

	* Added local namespace for util functions, and fixed the return
	  type of checkDeprecatedData()

2013-06-20 12:15  robert

	* From Vladimir Chebaev, "I worked with osg::Particle and see that
	  this class has setter osgParticle::setTextureTileRange and has no
	  getters for startTile and endTile. This can be very
	  uncomfortable.
	  I attached file with two getters."

2013-06-20 10:59  robert

	* Commented out verbose debug messages for shader composition

2013-06-20 10:42  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS file

2013-06-20 10:05  robert

	* From Juan Manuel Alvarez, "When handling keyboard events on
	  osgQt, if a key is kept pressed, multiple sequences of KEYDOWN ->
	  KEYUP events are fired.
	  
	  This is because Qt auto repeats keyboard events, so multiple
	  calls are made to GLWidget::keyPressEvent and
	  GLWidget::keyReleaseEvent by Qt, and subsequently translated to
	  OSG events.
	  
	  The way to solve this is ignoring key released auto repeated
	  events (see
	  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qkeyevent.html#isAutoRepeat), so
	  multiple KEYDOWN events are fired, but only one KEYUP.
	  
	  I attach a modified osgQt/GraphicsWindowQt.cpp with this change."

	* From Jan Ciger, "I have found a problem when building OSG with Qt
	  5 support. Qt has the
	  following in the qopengl.h header:
	  
	  # include <QtGui/qopengles2ext.h>
	  # ifndef GL_DOUBLE
	  # define GL_DOUBLE GL_FLOAT
	  # endif
	  # ifndef GLdouble

	  Unfortunately, when building for normal OpenGL (not GL/ES!) on
	  Windows
	  with MSVC2012, GLdouble is not defined (it is not a macro but
	  typedef)
	  and the code above produces a conflicting definition, making the
	  compile fail. I am attaching a bit hackish workaround for this
	  problem
	  in osg/GL "

2013-06-19 10:56  robert

	* Build fixes for new deprecated osg::Geometry functions

2013-06-18 19:09  robert

	* Added #define OSG_USE_DEPRECATED_GEOMETRY_METHODS usage into code
	  to allow code to compile enen when CMake configuration has set
	  the #define to off in include/osg/Config.

2013-06-18 17:49  robert

	* Moved the assignment of the normal binding to after the
	  setNormalArray call

2013-06-18 17:48  robert

	* Moved the Geometry::set*Binding to after the set*Array() to
	  prevent problems when using the deprecated functionality.

2013-06-18 15:54  robert

	* Removed BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE reference

2013-06-18 15:03  robert

	* Moved the set binding and normalize for VertexAttrib to after the
	  VertexAttrib array assignment

2013-06-18 14:52  robert

	* Changed header guard back to original, and removed deprecated
	  enum

2013-06-18 14:22  robert

	* Fixed order of binding.

2013-06-18 11:49  robert

	* Removed experiment GeometryNew as it's no longer required.

2013-06-18 11:18  robert

	* Clean up up osg::Geometry, removing long deprecated support for
	  array indices and BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE binding that forced OpenGL
	  slow paths. osg::Geometry is now smaller and only supports OpenGL
	  fasts paths.
	  New methods osg::Geometry::containsDeprecatedData() and
	  osg::Geometry::fixDeprecatedData() provide a means for converting
	  geometries that still use the array indices and
	  BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE across to complient
	  versions.
	  
	  Cleaned up the rest of the OSG where use of array indices and
	  BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE were accessed or used.

2013-06-14 09:43  robert

	* Fixed TextBase::computeBound() so it take into account all
	  corners of the text box thus ensuring proper handling of rotated
	  text

2013-06-12 12:49  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, replace osgDB::fstream with an osgDB::open()
	  call.

2013-06-11 10:52  robert

	* Introduced new osg::PatchParameter StateAttribute class to wrap
	  up glPatchParameter associated state.
	  Note, osg::Program::setParameter(GL_PATCH_VERTICES,num); is
	  nolonger support and should be replaced by using the new
	  PatchParameter class.

2013-06-11 10:49  robert

	* Fixed indentation

2013-06-11 09:05  robert

	* Refactored the way the ReadResult/WriteResult lists are handled,
	  with them now being sorted so that the Read/WriteResult with
	  highest numerical value ReadStatus/WriteStatus is returned.
	  Changed the enum order of ReadStatus/WriteStatus to ensure that
	  the more relevant errors are last and with the highest numerical
	  value

2013-06-10 14:34  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, with additions from Riccardo Corsi and
	  Robert Milharcic, support for Qt5 build

2013-06-10 10:37  robert

	* Fixed remove and add callback so they properly handle nested
	  callbacks

2013-06-07 10:54  robert

	* From Marcin Prus, "I don't know if you seen my second reply to
	  your information about merging my Image and dds plugin changes. I

	  It's
	  return osg::Image::computeImageSizeInBytes(width, height, depth,

2013-06-07 10:52  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "attached is a change to osgsharedarray
	  to move completely to the fast geometry
	  path. Also the arrays are moved back to static storage since this
	  is the data
	  that is actually referenced in draw. So the change moving this
	  onto the stack
	  that happend somewhere before broke this."

2013-06-06 08:23  robert

	* Replaced OpenThreads::Mutex with a OpenThreads::ReentrantMutex to
	  allow draw callbacks to use Renderer.

2013-06-05 07:55  robert

	* Reorder member variables to ensure better packing in memory.

2013-06-05 07:27  robert

	* Moved the Array::AttribDivisor into the Array::Binding enum to
	  avoid conflicts in settings between Binding and AttribDivisor.
	  
	  Removed the vertify bindings/shared arrays handling from
	  GeometryNew

2013-06-04 19:04  robert

	* Updates to GeometryNew, Array and ArraDispatchers to clean up
	  GeometryNew so that is no longer uses ArrayData.

2013-06-04 14:55  robert

	* Added s/getNormalize(), s/getPreserveDataType(),
	  s/getAttribDivisor() and s/getBinding() to osg::Array base class
	  in preperation for refactor of osg::Geometry and introduction of
	  new features.

2013-06-04 14:43  robert

	* Removed now redundent osggeodemo

2013-06-04 13:29  robert

	* Removed geo plugin as the modelling tool it was assocaited is
	  long defunct.

2013-06-04 10:06  robert

	* Cleaned up BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE and array indice usage

2013-06-04 09:32  robert

	* Introduced GeometryNew which is a cleaned up version of Geometry
	  that removes support for array indices.
	  GeometryNew is only temporary and will be renamed to Geometry on
	  the completion of refactoring work and feedback from community.
	  Ported osggeometry across to use GeometryNew.

2013-06-04 09:29  robert

	* Removed deprecated usage of osg::Geometry indices and
	  BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE

2013-06-03 15:10  robert

2013-06-03 14:27  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "Autodesk released a new version of their
	  FBX Software Development Kit (web page
	  http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775847).
	  The API has changed quite a bit, so lots of changes had to be
	  made in the osg readerwriter. The preious version of the FBX SDK
	  (2013.3) already deprecated a lot of the names and functions. The
	  code I submit now still compiles against 2013.3 (possibly needs a
	  #define FBX_NEW_API). Not sure if that's useful, but it might

	* From Laurens Voerman, "while updating dependencies I found a
	  problem with libgif 5 from
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib/
	  a change in version 5.0.0 required a call to the fuction
	  "DGifOpen" to pass an int ref for an error code.

2013-06-03 14:01  robert

	* From Sergey Polischuk, "this patch fixes light id in gl modes for
	  osg::LightSource's readed from fbx (previously all lightsources

2013-05-31 10:23  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached is a patch that fixes another
	  clang++ compiler warning when returning
	  std::vector::size() as 'unsigned int'.
	  "

2013-05-30 09:07  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The osgdb_nvtt plugin needs to be updated to work
	  with the latest NVTT library, which changes the interface
	  slightly (adding a new pure virtual method endImage()). I've
	  modified the source file and attached it here."

2013-05-28 19:16  robert

	* Renamed PanoramicSphericalDisplay.cpp to fix a typo

2013-05-28 16:39  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and Contributors list

2013-05-28 15:43  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The logic for handling opacity maps in
	  the 3ds reader seems to be incorrect. It checks whether the
	  diffuse texture contains transparency, instead of the opacity
	  texture. If the diffuse does not contain an alpha channel it
	  outputs the warning:
	  
	  The plugin does not support images without alpha channel for
	  opacity
	  
	  This seems to indicate that the check for alpha should be against
	  the opacity map. I've attached the updated file.
	  
	  "

2013-05-28 15:40  robert

	* From Michael Bach Jensen and Robert Osfield, "As discussed
	  (http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=12027) here is
	  my submission :-)
	  
	  The following change to State.cpp fixes the case where textures
	  in a stateset along with a compute shader program did not make
	  those textures available to the shader, since it got evaluated
	  before the texture bind(s)."
	  
	  Note from Robert, Michael only change State::apply(StateSet*) so
	  I also applied the same reversal in apply of texutre modes/state
	  into the State::apply() method for consistency.

2013-05-28 15:18  robert

	* Replaced the initialization of the strarray to use reseve instead
	  of a initial size provided in the constructor as this was leading
	  to a bug in output.

2013-05-28 14:40  robert

	* Fixed date typo

2013-05-28 14:35  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I just started looking into the shader
	  composition feature. I enabled shader composition on the
	  osg::State object and noticed a 6x increase in draw time. I
	  figured that the default composer might have performance issues,
	  so I created a custom ShaderComposer that overrides
	  "getOrCreateProgram" and does nothing. This still resulted in a
	  performance drop.
	  
	  I looked into the "State::applyShaderComposition" method and
	  noticed that it will print debug information to the osg::INFO
	  stream. I commented that line out and the performance drop was
	  gone.
	  
	  I'm not sure if the printing was accidentally left in or is meant
	  to be enabled. I've modified the function to only call the print
	  function if INFO logging is enabled. I've attached the change."

2013-05-28 14:14  robert

	* From Marcin Prus and Robert Osfield, moved the key parts of the
	  .dds plugins computeRowWidthInBytes implementation into the
	  osg::Image::computeImageSizeInBytes(..) to
	  address bugs in the computation of image size.

2013-05-28 11:47  robert

	* From Sukender, "Added ".dds" file deletion on writing failure."

2013-05-28 11:46  robert

	* From Sukender, "Added vertical flipping to the writer depending
	  on the Image::getOrigin() value (= flip the image when
	  Image::BOTTOM_LEFT). Most of the time this will not change DDS
	  writing (= no v-flip), as it seems images are rarely
	  "BOTTOM_LEFT". To skip this behaviour, the "ddsNoAutoFlipWrite"
	  option was added.
	  I also moved a few lines of code about "dds_flip" option, and
	  made options reading more like in other ReaderWriters."

2013-05-28 11:44  robert

	* From Diane Delallée & Sukender, "Added some support of
	  non-modulus-4 dimensions in S3TC-DXTC images (previous
	  implementation seem just not to handle these properly).
	  - Added missing packing value on S3TC images. Images are coded
	  with 4x4 blocs, whatever the image size. So there is an
	  horizontal packing of 4 pixels (2 bytes in DXT1, 4 bytes in
	  DXT2-5).
	  - Added crash guard against writing corrupted S3TC images.
	  Notes:
	  - What is missing is a support of "lines packing" in osg::Image
	  (see code comments).
	  - S3TC-DXTC vertical flipping crashes (access violation) with
	  some unusual dimensions (see code). I could not implement missing
	  cases, so I added guards to avoid crashing."

2013-05-28 11:25  robert

	* From Diane Delallée and Sukender, "1. Image.cpp
	  Failure to perform a vertical flip on S3TC-DXTC now simply leaves
	  the original image instead of corrupting it.
	  Image.cpp was sometimes performing a "normal" (= for uncompressed
	  images) vertical flip on S3TC-DXTC images, producing weird
	  results.
	  Actually, code was trying a "DXTC vertical flip" and relied on
	  the result to call a "normal vertical flip". But when the "DXTC
	  v-flip" encounters an error, this is is not necessarily because
	  the image is not S3TC (ex: unhandled image dimensions)!
	  So now the code simply does "if dxtc, then flip_dxtc; else
	  flip_normal;".
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, moved the isDXT function into the
	  dxt_tool file and namespace.

2013-05-28 10:46  robert

	* Resrtuctured the use of static's in the Uniform::getNameID()
	  method to avoid problems under Android.

2013-05-24 17:06  robert

	* From Jordi Torres, "We must use JNI_FALSE instead of false in JNI
	  code. Otherwise the examples will not compile. This patch should
	  be applied to osgAndroidExampleGLES1/jni and
	  osgAndroidExampleGLES2/jni. the osgNativeLib.cpp is the same. "

2013-05-24 09:43  robert

	* Removed redudent code

2013-05-24 09:35  robert

	* Fixed panning bug, when using RUN_ON_DEMAND, that resulted in the
	  camera being thrown off towards infinity.
	  
	  The solution for to refactor the way that events are checked so I
	  add a bool return type to checkEvents() method across
	  osgViewer::GraphcisWindow, osgGA::Devive and
	  osgViewer::Viewer/CompositeViewer classes

2013-05-23 18:29  robert

	* Added repolation of the _deadparts stack which would otherwise
	  been invalidatd by the depth sort of particles.

2013-05-23 15:55  robert

	* From Pawel Ksiezopolski, Added example of using
	  osg::TextureBuffer + GLSL to render forest.

2013-05-23 14:14  robert

	* From David Fries, "This updates the CMakeLists.txt instructions
	  for the commands
	  to make the doxygen documentation."

2013-05-23 12:29  robert

	* Refactored the idle mechanism to fix problems with the vnc thread
	  going idle when it shouldn't have.

2013-05-23 10:25  robert

	* Quitened down debug messages

2013-05-22 13:16  robert

	* Removed debug messages

2013-05-22 13:09  robert

	* From Nico Kruithof, "For the VNC server, it seems that the wrong
	  include path is used.
	  
	  Instead of
	  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${LIBVNCCLIENT_INCLUDE_DIR})
	  the CMake variable
	  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${LIBVNCSERVER_INCLUDE_DIR})
	  should be used.
	  
	  Attached is a fix for src/osgPlugins/vnc/CMakeLists.txt"

2013-05-22 12:49  robert

	* From Pawel Ksiezopolski, first email: "This submission adds
	  texture buffer object ( defined in GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object
	  extension ) to the osg::Texture* family.
	  
	  TextureBuffer objects may use osg::Texture::bindToImageUnit(), so
	  GLSL shaders are able to use not only texelFetch() function , but
	  also functions defined in GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store
	  extension : imageLoad(), imageStore(), imageAtomicAdd() etc."
	  
	  second email: "After a while I found that
	  osg::Texture::applyTexParameters() used with TextureBuffer may
	  cause some OpenGL errors ( applying texture filters and wraps to
	  TextureBuffer makes no sense ) so I fixed it."

2013-05-22 11:06  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "Here is a little patch to fix a bug in the
	  InfluenceMap serialization. The names of the maps weren't quoted
	  properly and therefore it was breaking loading of rigged models
	  exported from e.g. Blender. Also names that contained spaces
	  wouldn't have been parsed properly. "

2013-05-22 10:28  robert

	* From David Callu, "ust a simple IF ENDIF mismatch in last commit
	  (I use git so no available SVN commit number ) :
	  
	  CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
	  A logical block opening on the line
	  
	  /home/ledocc/work/perso/osg_Workspace/osg/CMakeLists.txt:823 (IF)
	  
	  closes on the line
	  
	  /home/ledocc/work/perso/osg_Workspace/osg/CMakeLists.txt:893
	  (ENDIF)
	  
	  with mis-matching arguments.
	  
	  I remove ENDIF argument, it is no longer needed by cmake"

2013-05-21 17:41  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I'm working on a custom ShaderComposer
	  and I need access to the full StateSetStack of the State object
	  within the getOrCreateProgram() method. The problem is that
	  "State::apply(const StateSet* dstate)" does not add the specified
	  stateset to the stack. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but
	  I've updated the function to push/pop the stateset.
	  
	  I hope the change seems reasonable. I searched the entire code
	  base for code that accesses the StateSetStack, and noticed
	  RenderBin and RenderStage use it. However, I don't think that
	  code would ever be called from within the State::apply()
	  function, so I'm fairly confident the change should be safe."

2013-05-21 10:22  robert

	* From Valeriy Dubov, fix for Android build under OSX

2013-05-21 09:48  robert

	* From Alexander Sinditskiy, "I just noticed that Dragger allways
	  handle events even when
	  handle(const PointerInfo&, const osgGA::GUIEventAdapter&,
	  osgGA::GUIActionAdapter&)
	  returns false.I think it is not correct...i think handled should
	  be changed only when it is really handled."

	* Added use of SingleWindow for when only one screen is used

2013-05-20 19:24  robert

	  line parsing

2013-05-15 11:31  robert

	* Introduced osgViewer::Config base class and beginnigs of various
	  Config implementations.
	  Introduced osgViewer serializers plugin for serialization support
	  for osgViewer::Config implementations and Keystone

2013-05-14 16:23  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "When a function do:
	  
	  OSG_DEBUG << "Hello world!\n";
	  
	  the underlying stream is not automatically flushed. It is flushed
	  if endl is queued instead of \n:
	  
	  OSG_DEBUG << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
	  
	  
	  The notify macros do:
	  stream->setCurrentSeverity(severity);
	  return *stream;
	  
	  So, if a function do:
	  
	  OSG_DEBUG << "This is a debug message\n";
	  OSG_NOTICE << "This is a notice message" << std::endl;
	  
	  the debug message will be classified as a notice message.
	  
	  It is a problem when the application uses a NotifyHandler. The
	  notify
	  method of the handler is called with:
	  
	  severity = NOTICE
	  message = "This is a debug message\nThis is a notice message"
	  
	  The attached Notify.cpp contains an automatic flush of the stream
	  when
	  the current severity changes.
	  
	  "

2013-05-14 16:18  robert

	* From Michael Kapelko, "The provided patch (against SVN revision
	  13380) adds missing constness to returning calls (without it the
	  user code does not compile)."

2013-05-14 16:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The tga image loader was not properly
	  reading in 16-bit images. Fix is attached."

2013-05-14 16:12  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "Attached is a patch that introduces
	  'static_cast<unsigned int>' on some instances where
	  the code returns '.size()' of a std::vector. This caused some
	  warnings when using clang++
	  on OS X."

2013-03-11 17:16  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "There is a little bug in the
	  osg::Group::insertChild method :
	  
	  If the index is more than the size of _children vector, the new
	  child is pushed at the end of the vector, but the index value is
	  unmodified, so an incorrect value is passed to the
	  "childInserted" method."

2013-02-22 17:42  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, " Adds missing copy for _bbox member variable
	  to copy constructor:
	  
	  LightPointNode::LightPointNode(const LightPointNode& lpn,const
	  osg::CopyOp& copyop):
	  osg::Node(lpn,copyop),

	  _lightSystem(lpn._lightSystem),
	  _pointSprites(lpn._pointSprites)
	  {
	  }
	  
	  
	  Lacking this causes _bbox to be uninitialized after LOD changes
	  when paged databases refer to shared subgraphs.
	  
	  "

	  This is discussed in this thread[1].
	  The solution is to add <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="8" /> to

	* From Mike Connell, "3 smaller fixes for the 3DS loader (against
	  trunk)
	  
	  1. Respect "noMatrixTransforms" option for matrices attached to
	  meshes, not only those attached to nodes
	  
	  2. traverse_nodes variable did the exact opposite of it's
	  description.
	  
	  3. Always try to load referenced textures, even if we can't find
	  the files (in order to the the registry's ReadFileCallback have a
	  stab at it)

	* From Wee See, Support for importing OpenFlight Surface Material
	  Codes using osg::Object::UserValue. Notes from Wee See:
	  
	  See attached my ported code, which fulfills:
	  
	  - using of setUserValue()/getUserValue()
	  - user-value will be attached to Geode or Drawable
	  - actually 3 values will be added: SMC (surface), FID (feature)
	  and IRC (IRcolor). Its UserValue-names are < UA:SMC >, < UA:FID >
	  and < UA:IRC > (without spaces!)
	  - user-value will be attached to Geode or Drawable
	  - has an option (named preserveNonOsgAttrsAsUserData) for control
	  whether the UserValues should be attached (Default: no UserValues
	  will be attached)
	  
	  Reading out this values is very simple. Here is an example
	  (uservalue-name without spaces!):
	  
	  signed short smc;
	  if (myGeode.getUserValue("< UA:SMC >", smc))
	  {
	  doSomethingWithTheGeodeAndItsSmc(myGeode, smc);

	* Added TODO note about RGB -> RGBA

2013-02-06 12:46  robert

	* From David Longest, "I have updated the FFmpeg plugin to support
	  the 1.0 release version of FFmpeg. The files attached were
	  modified in order to facilitate the update. Below are the details
	  for all changes made.
	  
	  
	  
	  Header update
	  
	  FindFFmpeg.cmake has been changed in order to support the new
	  header include format for FFmpeg. In the 1.0 release, a new file
	  had been added with the name “time.h” in the avutil library. The
	  previous method of adding includes caused conflicts with the ANSI
	  C “time.h” file. Now the include directive will only use the main
	  include folder. All files using the old include format have been
	  updated to reflect the change.
	  
	  
	  
	  Added __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS define to CMakeLists.txt
	  
	  Since there is no guarantee that FFmpegHeaders.hpp will be
	  included before stdint.h is included, the define has been moved
	  from FFmpegHeaders.hpp to be part of the CMakeLists.txt for the
	  FFmpeg plugin. This will allow the define to work on all
	  compilers regardless of include order.
	  
	  
	  
	  Replaced AVFormatParameters with AVDictionary
	  
	  AVFormatParameters is no longer supported in FFmpeg and has been
	  replaced with a key/value map of strings for each setting.
	  FFmpegParameters and FFmpegDecoder has been updated to reflect
	  this.
	  
	  
	  
	  Replaced av_open_input_file with avformat_open_input
	  
	  FFmpeg now opens files using avformat_open_input. Since the
	  av_open_input_file method is deprecated, the FFmpegDecoder class
	  has been updated to reflect this change.
	  
	  
	  
	  Added custom AVIOContext field to options
	  
	  Since some formats and inputs may not be supported by FFmpeg, I
	  have added a new parameter that allows a user to allocate their
	  own AVIOContext. This class will allow for creating a read, seek,
	  and write callback if they desire.
	  
	  
	  
	  Checking for start_time validity
	  
	  It is possible for some file formats to not provide a start_time
	  to FFmpeg. This would cause stuttering in the video since the
	  clocks class would be incorrect.
	  
	  
	  
	  Removed findVideoStream and findAudioStream
	  
	  The new FFmpeg release already has a function that will find the
	  best audio and video stream. The code has been replaced with this
	  function.
	  
	  
	  
	  Updated error reporting
	  
	  Some functions would not log an error when opening a file or
	  modifying a file failed. New logs have been added as well as a
	  function to convert error numbers to their string descriptions.
	  
	  
	  
	  decode_video has been replaced
	  
	  The old decode_video function would remove extra data that some
	  decoders use in order to properly decode a packet. Now
	  av_codec_decode_video2 has replaced that function.
	  
	  
	  
	  Picture format changed from RGBA32 to RGB24
	  
	  Since most video will not contain an alpha channel, using a 24
	  bit texture will use less memory."

2013-02-06 12:02  robert

	* Simplified include/osg/Math to use Standard C++ maths headers -
	  <cmath> and <cfloat>

	  multiple times to workaround network packet losses.

2013-01-30 11:31  robert

	* Added handling of movies into Timeout

2013-01-30 10:49  robert

	* Added disabling of the traversal of the Timeout in update when
	  the timout is not displayed and disabled traversal by the
	  SlideEventHandler.

2013-01-30 10:40  robert

	* Fixed the erronous header so that it is OSGPL like the rest of
	  the osgAnimation.

2013-01-30 10:21  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "As I have not all referenced image-data,
	  SlideShowConstructor crashed on my end. Attached is a fix for
	  that crash."

2013-01-28 14:56  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've fixed the bug of writing/reading scenes
	  including the ImageSequence serializer. Current trunk version
	  will fail when handing image sequences because it forces to set
	  className to "osg::Image" in InputStream.cpp. I have to read a
	  value saved in file instead so I must add a hardhanded version
	  checking for backward compatibility.
	  
	  Now we can work with ImageSequence objects, in both osgt and osgb
	  files."

2013-01-28 14:30  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I have implemented and tested (on windows
	  only) your suggestion for resetCullingMask(), it's far less
	  intrusive than my previous submission.
	  attached are the changes to current svn (28 Jan 2013 / rev
	  :13312).
	  "

2013-01-25 16:54  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth, "Attached are two minor modifications to the
	  master CMakeLists.txt file.
	  
	  It now points to sdk version 6.0 (I do intend to make this
	  configurable my command line)
	  
	  It also added a search for libtiff to Apple builds mainly for use
	  with osg earth."

2013-01-25 11:54  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "In the attached files I've added the Compute
	  Shader support for OSG, as well as serializer updates and a new
	  osgcomputeshaders example. My submission also include a
	  setComputeGroups() function in Program for setting compute-shader
	  work groups, and a bindToImageUnit() function in Texture for
	  binding textures as image variables in shaders.
	  
	  All code are tested on Windows 7 + NVIDIA GFX 570 with the latest
	  GeForce 310.70 Driver (BETA), which could support OpenGL 4.3.
	  
	  Compute shader information can be found at
	  "http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/compute_shader.txt"
	  "

2013-01-25 11:08  robert

	* From Lukasz Izdebski, "Adding this GL mode makes possibly to use
	  this GL Modes (added in core OpenGL 3.2) in Windows."

2013-01-25 10:36  robert

	* Fixed compile warning

2013-01-25 10:24  robert

	* Added debug message for Timout

2013-01-24 18:48  robert

	* Fixed usage of META_NodeVisitor so it doesn't include ""

2013-01-23 17:38  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "when you restart threading
	  with startThreading/stopThreading the _drawQueue and
	  _availableQueue
	  are not reset properly. This can lead to a deadlock when
	  threading is
	  started again. So before threading is started again the queues
	  must be
	  reset. This deadlock is also reported earlier by someone else in
	  here:
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?p=43415#43415"

2013-01-23 17:37  robert

	* From Pjotr Svetachov, "small bug which I have found in the
	  FlattenStaticTransformsDuplicatingSharedSubgraphsVisitor: the
	  visitor
	  will replace part of the tree when visiting the nodes but it does
	  not
	  update the current node path to reflect this. If you then have
	  multiple nested transform nodes it will usually crash and
	  sometimes it
	  won't crash but the resulting mesh will miss some nodes."

2013-01-23 16:27  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have extended the dds loader by some
	  newer DX10 texture formats. Especially
	  the float texture formats.
	  I need a few of these formats somewhere but have extended
	  everything that I
	  found plausible and was easy to find a GL texture type/format
	  for.
	  For some float32 type of texture the files the implementation
	  seem to work fine.
	  The rest lacks testing.
	  The writer side is not implemented."

2013-01-23 16:22  robert

	* From Wang Rui with edits from Robert Osfield, additional GLenums
	  for cross platform build

2013-01-23 15:54  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, fixed typo bug

2013-01-23 11:50  robert

	* Removed redundent code block

2013-01-23 11:45  robert

	* From Lukasz Izdebski, "I found problem with rgb plugin.
	  Internal format of rgb image is wrongly set ( diffrent then in
	  other images type plugin ), because of that using rgb images in
	  osg::Texture2DArray causes a bug."

2013-01-23 11:20  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a patch that includes the
	  stereo cameras in
	  Renderer::*etCameraRequiresSetUp.
	  
	  I am not sure if the getter needs to be changed, but this is
	  currently
	  included for consistency."

2013-01-22 16:53  robert

	* From Alessandro Terenzi, "I've modified the avfoundation plugin
	  to copy the preferredTransform matrix into the UserData property
	  of the corresponding imagestream: by doing so, we can realize if
	  the video should be transformed when applied as a texture (this
	  should be the case, for instance, when we record a movie using an
	  iOS device with any orientation different than 'landscape
	  left')."

2013-01-22 16:13  robert

	* Added <template_layer name="layerbase_1"> and <layer
	  inherit="layerbase_1"> functionality to .p3d functionality.

2013-01-22 10:33  robert

	* Added extra check against whether node needs to be traversed in
	  update and event traversals to prevent osgPresentation::Timeout
	  being classified as a node that can be removed.

2013-01-18 17:11  robert

	* Added Options support to ImageSequence LOAD_* functionality

2013-01-18 16:30  robert

	* Update SO_VERSION to reflect new API changes

2013-01-18 16:21  robert

	* Added LOAD_AND_RETAIN_IN_UPDATE_TRAVERSAL and
	  LOAD_AND_DISCARD_IN_UPDATE_TRAVERSAL ImageSequence::Mode's to
	  allow for ImageSequence usage without using background paging
	  threads, instead loading all the images on demand in the update
	  traversal.

2013-01-17 13:51  robert

	* Added <display_broadcast_event> and <dismiss_broadcast_event>
	  support to <timeout> to allow the different timeout statges to be
	  broadcast.

2013-01-17 11:57  robert

	* Changed the defaults of the Timeout to be DBL_MAX by default.

2013-01-17 11:48  robert

	* Completed <timeout> support, to use it with p3d use it along the
	  lines:
	  
	  <slide>
	  <layer>

	* Added support for <timeout_jump> to Timeout support.

2013-01-16 16:13  robert

	* Implemented basic Timeout display and timing codes

2013-01-15 11:31  robert

	* Added shell of Timeout class

2013-01-11 11:30  robert

	* Added movie volume animation control to <image> and
	  <stereo_image> tags to be used in the form:
	  
	  <slide>
	  <properties>
	  <property name="volume" type="float">0.20</property>

	  <layer>
	  <image volume="$volume"
	  looping="ON">big_buck_bunny_1080p_stereo.ogg</image>
	  </layer>
	  </slide>

2013-01-10 19:55  robert

	* Added support for <image delay="time" stop="time"> properties
	  that works in conjunction with the start="time" property support
	  checked in in previous submission,
	  together these control the delay, start position and stop
	  position of movies.

2013-01-10 14:37  robert

	* Added support for <image "start=10"> property that tells a video
	  to start specificied number of sections into a video.

2013-01-10 10:53  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "thanks for your input, unfortunately I could
	  not get it working with packing, but setting the row-length works
	  now. Seems I had it wrong the first time.
	  
	  Attached are both files. This should fix the video-bug mentioned
	  on the dlf-wiki.
	  
	  "

2013-01-09 16:29  robert

	* Changed the named colours back to having a alpha value of 1.0 to
	  avoid problems with text not appearing.

2013-01-09 16:03  robert

	* Added reset of the cursorFileName when hideCursor is activated to
	  prevent the custom cursor being enabled.

2013-01-08 10:21  robert

	* Added case for FORWARD_EVENT to address warning

2013-01-07 15:03  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "I get a compile error on Windows VS2008
	  wih new DAE plugin, here is a fix :
	  
	  
	  _document = _dae->openFromMemory(fileURI, buffer.data());
	  
	  "data" method is unknow for std::vector with VS2008
	  
	  I've replaced it with :
	  
	  _document = _dae->openFromMemory(fileURI, &buffer[0]);
	  "

2013-01-07 12:41  robert

	* Added support for --show-cursor and --hide-cursor command line
	  options, and P3D_SHOW_CURSOR env var that can be set to YES or
	  NO.

2013-01-07 12:17  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "* osgGA: fixed a small bug regarding
	  emulating mouse-events from touch-events
	  * resthttp/osc: encapsulate RequestHandler-classes in their own
	  namespaces to prevent class-name-lookup-errors in the
	  debugger/code (had some weird crashes)
	  * QTKit: fixed a compile-bug for gcc and blocks
	  * osgPresentation: click_to_* will fire on RELEASE, only if the
	  drawable received a PUSH beforehand
	  * p3d/osgPresentation: implemented
	  "forward_mouse_event_to_device"-tag, which will forward
	  mouse-events to all registered devices of a viewer, if an
	  intersection occurs. The mouse-coordinates get reprojected
	  * present3d: all devices get registered with the viewer
	  * osgViewer: only devices which are capable of receiving events
	  are queried for new events.
	  * GraphicWindowIOS: added a flag to GraphicWindowIOS::WindowData
	  to set up a retained backing buffer (defaults to false) This will
	  enable read-back of the render-buffer with glReadPixels even
	  after the renderbuffer got presented
	  * curl: added an optimized check for file-existance, now only the
	  headers are requested and checked, instead of reading the whole
	  file and handle it with a ReaderWriter
	  * p3d: fixed a bug, where the existence of a local file may
	  prevent the remote loading of a file with the same name.
	  
	  "

2012-12-20 16:16  robert

	* Made UpdateVisitor::TravesalMode default to
	  TRAVERSE_ACTIVE_CHILDREN

2012-12-20 12:14  robert

2012-12-19 17:14  robert

	* Removed lighting of trk lines

2012-12-19 12:38  robert

	* Changed the colour calculation and added gl_ClipVertex to enable
	  clipping.

2012-12-18 11:20  robert

	* Removed erroneous region setting

2012-12-18 09:49  robert

	* From Juergen Rensen, "This is a fix for the latest SVN version
	  (rev 13269). The ‘destroyFrameBuffer’ method in
	  ‘GraphicsWindowIOS.mm’ had ‘glDeleteFramebuffersOES’ calls for
	  the stencil buffer, MSAA render buffer and MSAA depth buffer
	  instead of ‘glDeleteRenderbuffersOES’. The fix changes the
	  mismatched calls to ‘glDeleteRenderbuffersOES’.
	  
	  
	  
	  The impact of the bug was a memory leak that would affect
	  multi-sampling iOS apps that allow for device rotation or window
	  resizing in general. For our app, the leak ranged from ca. 10 MB
	  to 40 MB per device rotation, depending on device, for the MSAA
	  buffers. I have not been able to confirm impact for the stencil
	  buffer. "

2012-12-17 15:58  robert

	* Added support for RGBA colour buffer in osgframerenderer using
	  the --rgba command line option (--rgb selects the standard non
	  colour frame buffer which is the default).

2012-12-16 17:10  robert

	* Added handling of aspect ratio for vertical/horizontal split
	  stereo.

2012-12-14 16:31  robert

	* From Stephan Hunber, "* now you can create a transparent
	  opengl-view (see GraphicWindowIOS::WindowData)
	  * changes of the view's bound are reported via osg's event-system
	  more reliably
	  
	  "

2012-12-14 16:30  robert

	* Updated SO version

2012-12-13 17:35  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "Here is a correction on the
	  PixelBufferObject getter methods of Image.
	  
	  The set method modify the buffer object of the BufferData while
	  the get method returned the buffer object of the Image.
	  
	  I've also removed the _bufferObject member of Image (not used
	  anymore)."
	  --This line, Lionel Lagardeand those below, will be ignored--
	  
	  M include/osg/Image

2012-12-13 16:23  robert

	* Added --flip and --no-flip command line options to enable/disable
	  a vertical flip of the captured image before writing out to disk.

2012-12-07 19:05  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a zip containing some
	  bug-fixes and some refactored + new code.
	  
	  * ZeroConfDevice does now return FILE_NOT_HANDLED instead of
	  FILE_NOT_FOUND
	  * present3D supports multiple devices per env-var P3D_DEVICE,
	  separate multiple device with a space
	  
	  I refactored parts the p3d-plugin, the curl-plugin and parts of
	  Registry and ReaderWriter. Currently the p3d-plugin tries to open
	  all remote files with the help of the curl-plugin.
	  
	  I added a new method to Registry called
	  getReaderWriterForProtocolAndExtension. which will return a
	  ReaderWriter which is capable in handling the remote file for the
	  given protocol and extension. If no readerwriter is found for the
	  given extension, a list is built of all readerwriters supporting
	  the given protocol and this list is checked for support of
	  wildcards (extension = "*"). If anything matches it get returned.
	  
	  I added this principle also to the Registry, so now it's possible
	  to register a generic ReaderWriter which can handle all filetypes
	  for a given protocol, similar what curl is doing. All you have to
	  do is to load the plugin at startup. The curl-fallback is still
	  in place.
	  
	  With these changes it is now possible to reference a movie inside
	  a presentation without a server-address, read the presentation
	  (with curl) and stream the movie with the correct plugin (e.g.
	  QTKit)
	  
	  "

2012-12-07 19:04  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, attached is a fix for the bug of present3D
	  not loading fonts across http. I pass SlideShowConstructor's
	  options-object to readFontFile when constructing any text-objects
	  so freetype can pick up the font-data from the curl-plugin. It
	  works fine now on my end.

	  cMake accordingly)
	  * zeroconf: added ZeroConf-device-plugin (Mac/Win only, linux
	  implementation missing) to advertise and discover services via
	  ZeroConf/Bonjour, on windows you'll need the Bonjour SDK from

	  --zeroconf)
	  * SlideShowConstructor: enable/disable CoreVideo via a
	  environment variable (P3D_ENABLE_CORE_VIDEO)
	  * RestHttp: mouse-motion-events get interpolated
	  * RestHttp: unhandled http-requests get sent as an user-event to

	  * fixed a compile-error for IOS in GraphicsWindowIOS
	  * some minor bugfixes"

	* From Stephan Huber, "I've found a bug in
	  SlideShowConstructor::findFileAndRecordPath which does return an
	  empty string if the file was not found, and this empty string got
	  added to the fileNames-vector, so the curl-plugin tried to load
	  only an empty file-name, the directory-prefix. I fixed
	  findFileAndRecordPath, so it returns the unmodified filename,
	  which can then be loaded by the curl-plugin. Please review my
	  fix, as I am not sure if it has any side effects, as I know the
	  code not that well.
	  
	  The file includes another small compile-fix when using

	* From Stephan Huber, updated to debug output to RestHttpDevice and
	  tweaks to ImageIO and QTKit plugins

2012-11-05 09:36  robert

	* Added static cast to float to avoid compile error under MSV

2012-11-01 18:06  robert

	* From David Longest, "When drawing, a transform with an absolute
	  reference frame will ignore the
	  calculated model / view matrices up to that point. The
	  IntersectionVisitor would instead keep the
	  view matrices calculated up to that point even though the
	  Transform class will throw out the
	  calculated model matrix via “computeLocalToWorldMatrix.”
	  
	  The change I made will push an identity matrix as the view matrix
	  when running into a transform
	  with an absolute reference frame and will pop the matrix off
	  after the traverse.
	  
	  To test this, I created a camera with a perspective view and
	  added a transform with some geometry
	  in it. Afterwards, I set the transform’s reference frame to
	  ABSOLUTE_RF and spun the camera around
	  using the trackball manipulator. When trying to pick with a
	  LineSegmentIntersector, it would not
	  pick the geometry in the transform with the reference frame set
	  to ABSOLUTE_RF."

2012-11-01 16:11  robert

	* Fixed bug in click_to_run feature where events would be handled
	  by hidden labels

2012-10-24 10:43  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find the latest versions of
	  the QTKit + the AVFoundation-plugin, some changes to
	  osgPresentation and a small enhancement für ImageIO.
	  
	  I fixed some bugs and did some more tests with both of the
	  video-plugins. I integrated CoreVideo with osgPresentation,
	  ImageStream has a new virtual method called createSuitableTexture
	  which returns NULL for default implementations. Specialized
	  implementations like the QTKit-plugin return a CoreVideo-texture.
	  I refactored the code in SlideShowConstructor::createTexturedQuad
	  to use a texture returned from
	  ImageStream::createSuitableTexture.
	  
	  I did not use osgDB::readObjectFile to get the texture-object, as
	  a lot of image-related code in SlideShowConstructor had to be
	  refactored to use a texture. My changes are minimal and should
	  not break existing code.
	  
	  There's one minor issue with CoreVideo in general: As the
	  implementation is asynchronous, there might be no texture
	  available, when first showing the video the first frame. I am a
	  bit unsure how to tackle this problem, any input on this is
	  appreciated.
	  
	  Back to the AVFoundation-plugin: the current implementation does
	  not support CoreVideo as the QTKit-plugin supports it. There's no
	  way to get decoded frames from AVFoundation stored on the GPU,
	  which is kind of sad. I added some support for CoreVideo to
	  transfer decoded frames back to the GPU, but in my testings the
	  performance was worse than using the normal approach using
	  glTexSubImage. This is why I disabled CoreVideo for AVFoundation.
	  You can still request a CoreVideoTexture via readObjectFile,
	  though.
	  "

2012-10-23 16:15  robert

	* Added osgGA::Device class for integration of both physical and
	  virtual devices.
	  
	  Added template readFile(..) function to make it more convinient
	  to cast to a specific object type.
	  
	  Added support for osgGA::Device to osgViewer.
	  
	  Added sdl plugin to provides very basic joystick osgGA::Device

	* Removed the insert of requests in the
	  ImageSequence::_filesRequested data structure so that it always
	  requests files, leaving it up the ImagePager to decide to track
	  duplicates

2012-10-09 16:05  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I modified the Serializer header to add a
	  UPDATE_TO_VERSION_SCOPED
	  macro, which could set version within brackets and reset it after
	  that. All related serializers are also modified so that the
	  backward-compatibility bug reported by Farshid can be fixed.
	  "
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, removed the use of osg::Referenced and
	  creating the proxy object on the heap.

2012-10-08 16:14  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've added CDATA tag support to XmlParser so that
	  we can keep user
	  data (e.g., GLSL shader texts) in XML files without parsing them.
	  This
	  will be necessary for the coming-soon effect compositor
	  submission.
	  :-)"

	  conversion :
	  
	  b[1] = uint8_t((w & 0xFF00) >> 8);
	  
	  I replaced it with :

	  And it compiles fine
	  "

2012-10-08 12:00  robert

	* From Gill Peacegood, "In the attached file I have changed the
	  colour space used for writing images to match the one used for
	  reading images. Also this color space does not make subtle
	  changes to the original colours which i think is probably what
	  most people intend when writing an image and is more consistent
	  with other plugins.
	  
	  The effect is that an image that is written does not have a
	  noticeably different colour when it is read back."

2012-10-08 11:54  robert

	* From Oren Fromberg, ""
	  --This line, and thosAttached is an update to
	  ReaderWriterDAE.cpp/h and daeReader.cpp/h that implements
	  
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::ReadResult
	  
	  ReaderWriterDAE::readNode (std::istream&, const
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options*)
	  
	  This virtual function had never been implemented in
	  ReaderWriterDAE. I implemented this function because the DAE
	  plugin could not load files from other ReaderWriter derived
	  objects that use protocol handlers.
	  
	  I have updated function declarations in the header to have
	  identical signatures with the base class declarations that
	  include the default parameter.
	  
	  
	  readNode (std::istream&, …) is nearly identical to readNode(const
	  std::string &, …) except it uses a new private function to
	  convert the file from standard input:
	  
	  bool daeReader::convert( std::istream& fin )
	  
	  When this function is called fileURI is the string “from
	  std::istream” to make the user aware where the file is coming
	  from. Then instead of calling
	  
	  _dae->open(fileURI)
	  
	  we call
	  
	  _dae->openFromMemory(fileURI, buffer.data())
	  
	  Where buffer.data() is a pointer to the dae file text in memory.
	  
	  
	  Other changes include private functions to clear caches and to
	  consolidate redundant code that appears between the two convert
	  functions.

	  using it, and then creating a second view, the first view will
	  never render anything but black.
	  
	  What happens is this:
	  A view is created, and then the viewers thread is created and
	  runs.
	  The setReleaseContextAtEndOfFrameHint is true.
	  To create a second view, the viewer is setDone(true), and we wait
	  for the thread exit.
	  
	  At this point, inside the ViewerBase::RenderingTraversals code,
	  there are places where it reads "if(_done) return;"
	  
	  The problem, is that it won't reach the code that will
	  releaseContext().
	  
	  Apparently, this driver won't let any other thread to
	  makeCurrent(), if another thread (dead or not) has ownership. So
	  when the Viewers is re-started, the first view won't be able to
	  use the gc.
	  
	  The change attached (against rev 13153) corrects this."

2012-09-27 08:34  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth, "Apple have decided in their eternal wisdom
	  to do away with separate depth and stencil buffers on iOS from
	  version 5 and above.
	  
	  Attached are changes to GraphicsWindowIOS.mm to support setting
	  up the new buffer type when compiling for iOS5,
	  also attached is a small change to FrameBufferObject.cpp to
	  report support for packed depth stencil via the
	  GL_OES_packed_depth_stencil extension.
	  
	  For anyone reading this you can attach a packed depth stencil to
	  your FBO like so
	  
	  _rttCamera->attach( osg::Camera::PACKED_DEPTH_STENCIL_BUFFER,
	  GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_EXT );
	  
	  Luckily GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_EXT happens to have the same value as
	  iOSs GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES"

2012-09-26 08:42  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change to include/osg/GL correctly
	  includes the OpenGL header on OSX 10.7 when building OSG trunk
	  for GL3. It also adds some CPP defines for compatibility."

2012-09-25 11:04  robert

	* Changed dispatch to virtual

2012-09-24 10:10  robert

	* From Frederic Bouvier, "fix PNG write for images with bits per
	  components different than 8 that was hard coded."

2012-09-20 14:06  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "In the DXF plugin, DXF layers are decoded
	  and each layer is added in a separate group, which is very
	  usefull to retrieve a layer or display a list of all layers in
	  the aplication.
	  
	  But the layers are not always children of the "model root" node :
	  there can be a matrix transform between "model root" and "layers
	  parent", so I've added the name "Layers" on the node which
	  contains all layers to easily retrieve the layers groups from
	  application code."

2012-09-20 14:03  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, Added sRGB FrameBuffer string

2012-09-20 11:27  robert

	* From Vladimir Cheaev, "
	  I worked with a osg::Constraint and found strange part of code:
	  class OSGMANIPULATOR_EXPORT Constraint : public osg::Referenced
	  {
	  public:
	  ...
	  virtual bool constrain(ScaleUniformCommand& command) const {
	  return constrain((MotionCommand&)command); }
	  virtual bool constrain(const Rotate3DCommand& command) { return
	  constrain((MotionCommand&)command); }
	  ...
	  
	  If i use osgManipulator::Rotate3DCommand then method
	  Rotate3DCommand::accept(const Constraint& constraint) calls
	  Constraint::constrain(MotionCommand&) instead Constraint::
	  constrain(const Rotate3DCommand&).
	  
	  If you replace
	  virtual bool constrain(const Rotate3DCommand& command) { return
	  constrain((MotionCommand&)command); }
	  on to
	  virtual bool constrain(Rotate3DCommand& command) const { return
	  constrain((MotionCommand&)command); }
	  then all works correctly.
	  "

2012-09-20 11:18  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added GLBeginEndAdapter::reset(), and
	  _overallNormalAssigned, _overallColorAssigned flags to avoid the
	  GLBeginEndAdapter adapter setting colour and normals when none
	  has been assigned.

2012-09-20 11:16  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached is a patch to
	  src/osgViewer/CMakeLists.txt that inverts the logic of when to
	  use
	  Cocoa and when to use the old Carbon interface for the windowing
	  system.
	  
	  The old code had to be modified for every new OS X release to
	  default to Cocoa.
	  The new code uses Carbon for <= OS X 10.4 and Cocoa on everything
	  else."

2012-09-20 11:14  robert

	* Added ReadQueue::size() method to help with debugging.

2012-09-12 16:35  robert

	* Added handling of directory names in osgimagesequence
	  commandline.
	  
	  From Stephan Huber, added support for controlling the
	  ImageSequence seek position via mouse x position, toggled on/off
	  via 'i' key.

2012-09-12 16:02  robert

	* Added osgDB::getSortedDirectoryContents and
	  osgDB::FileNameComparator to help with sorting directory contents
	  into alphabetic and numerical order.

2012-09-12 11:09  robert

	* Converted sorting of directory contents across to use the new
	  osgDB::FileNameComparator and osgDB::getSortedDirectoryContents()

2012-09-10 08:24  robert

	* Updated version after 3.1.3 dev release

2012-09-07 17:04  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog for 3.1.3 dev release

2012-09-07 14:55  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "With current trunk I had an error
	  while compiling osg/Image.cpp for IOS simulator / GLES2. Symbol
	  GL_RGBA16 was missing. Adding #define GL_RGBA16 0x805B to Image
	  header solves the problem. "

2012-09-07 09:31  robert

	* Added setting of the input range of the event state based on the
	  master cameras viewport.

2012-09-07 08:33  robert

	* Added check so not intialization is down when you select the
	  current camera manipulator

2012-09-06 13:53  robert

	* From Piotr Domagalski, "I've added reading of node names ('DEF'
	  element) to the VRML reading plugin. The changes were based on
	  trunk's version of the plugin."

2012-09-06 13:48  robert

	* From Piotr Domagalski, "I've rewritten some bits of the STL
	  plugin in order to support ASCII STL files with multiple named
	  solids (reading and writing). The names are also used as OSG
	  nodes names.
	  
	  - Also, a 'dontSaveNormals' was added. It allows to ignore
	  normals when writing an STL file. For example, it is useful for
	  me when writing an STL file for CFD simulations.
	  
	  - Some comments and code formatting were improved (to be
	  consistent with the formatting already used in the plugin).
	  
	  - With 'separateFiles' option files are now named fooX.stl
	  instead of foo.stlX
	  
	  The changes have been tested on various STL, both ASCII and
	  binary found on the net. The change was based on the trunk
	  branch."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed assert in Piotr's code to a runtime
	  check warning report.

2012-09-06 10:52  robert

	* From Piotr Domagalski, "Currently, code using OpenSceneGraph
	  doesn't build with clang due to the way
	  __sync_bool_compare_and_swap() is used in OpenThreads/Atomic
	  header file.
	  
	  I tested it with clang 3.1 and it seems that clang is enforcing
	  the use of the same type for all parameters in this builtin.
	  Looking at the function declaration [1]
	  
	  bool __sync_bool_compare_and_swap (type *ptr, type oldval type
	  newval, ...)
	  
	  it seems to be doing the right thing: here the same type is used
	  for *ptr, oldval and newval.

	  issues.

2012-09-05 13:51  robert

	* Fixed inappropriate comment

2012-09-05 13:48  robert

	* Moved the OSG_INIT_SINGLETON_PROXY macro into include/osg/Object
	  to make it more generally useful and added it's usage into the
	  RenderBinPrototypeList initialization.

2012-09-05 10:27  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth, "I submitted a change for the IOS CMake
	  system a few weeks back which hasn't made it into the trunk. I've
	  just made the modifications again against the latest trunk and
	  have attached the file
	  
	  It basically accounts for the fact that XCode has changed it's
	  default install location.
	  
	  "

2012-09-05 10:24  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, The attached ESRIShape.cpp contains fixes
	  for comparing calculated byte sizes with the content length from
	  the record header. According to the ESRI Shape documentation
	  (http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf), the
	  content length is specified in 16 bit words, which is why I have
	  multiplied it by 2 when comparing to byte sizes. Note that the
	  comparison in line 813 is made with a fix number of 16-bit words
	  so it hasn't been changed.
	  
	  This fixes problems with PolygonZ records where the previous code
	  was reading past the end of the record since it thought it had M
	  values even if it didn't. I suspect the problem that James
	  McGlone had back in 2006 was the same but reversed, when he tried
	  to simply comment out the check, which was a (correctly) refused
	  submission.""

2012-09-05 10:19  robert

	* From Nico Kruithof, "There is a small typo in the ShapeDrawable
	  code for a sphere. There was a gl.Begin(GL_QUAD_STRIP) that was
	  never closed, nor used.
	  
	  "

2012-09-05 09:30  robert

	* Updated SO version number to avoid collision with new additions
	  to serializers

2012-09-05 09:08  robert

	* Added GL_RGBA8 and GL_RGBA16 entries to the
	  Image::computePixelFormat() and improved he readability of the

	* From Brad Christiansen, changed OSG_INFO to OSG_DEBUG to quieten
	  down volume of messages in INFO

2012-09-03 15:19  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "fix for the NVTTImageProcessor. When the
	  code was updated in revision 12912 a couple of typos where made.
	  These cause a crash when compressing transparent images and
	  mangled colours when compressing rgb images. "

2012-09-03 09:08  robert

	* Adjusted the #define's to help GLES2 build

2012-09-03 08:30  robert

	* From Lilin Xiong, " there is a small bug in
	  osgDB::readNodeFiles(std::vector<std::string>& fileList,const
	  Options* options) in file ReadFile.cpp line 85:
	  osg::Node *node = osgDB::readNodeFile( *itr ,
	  Registry::instance()->getOptions() );
	  It should be:
	  osg::Node *node = osgDB::readNodeFile( *itr , options );"

2012-08-31 16:00  robert

	* Added a fix for a multi-threading bug that occured when
	  TerrainTiles were accessed via the Terrain::_updateTerrainTileSet
	  that were being deleted at the same time by the DatabasePager
	  thread.

2012-08-29 16:48  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "This patch fixes a problem of the osg::Program
	  serializers that can't
	  save/load GeometryInputType data correctly. The bug is initially
	  found
	  by John Kelso."

2012-08-24 15:05  robert

	* From Johannes Scholz, fix for writing out of hexidecimal numbers

2012-08-23 15:06  robert

	* Fixed bug in
	  GLBufferObjectSet::discardAllDeletedGLBufferObjects() and

	* Added a mutex to protect the removal and addition of Uniform and
	  Program to StateSet to avoid parents being invalidated when
	  multi-threading.

2012-08-03 16:14  robert

	* Introduced --near-far-mode into osgshadow and
	  ShadowSettings::setComputeNearFarModeOverride(..) to allow user
	  control of how the cull traversal is optimized for computing the
	  depth range of the shadow map.

2012-08-03 15:23  robert

	* Removed the erronous creation of a local ShadowSettings object

	* Added FireGL to prefernce list for use glGenerateMipMap

2012-07-23 08:15  robert

	* Fixed build

2012-07-12 16:41  robert

	* Introduced
	  Texture::Extensions::s/getPreferGenerateMipmapSGISForPowerOfTwo()
	  flag that defaults to false for Radeon, true elsewhere.
	  This is used to workaround mipmapping bugs with ATI/AMD cards.

2012-07-11 14:36  robert

2012-07-10 15:50  robert

	* Moved mask settings into ShadowSettings

2012-07-09 17:49  robert

	* Changed updateCamera(Camera*) to updateCamera(Camera&) to make it
	  clear that a valid Camera object should be passed in.

2012-07-09 17:32  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, introduced CameraManipulator::updateCamera()
	  method that allows more Camera properties to be controlled by the
	  CameraManipulator.

2012-06-25 16:31  robert

	* Refactored the way that the static Scene cache is managed by
	  moving all the functionality into a SceneSingleton

2012-06-22 16:21  robert

	* Restructed the way that the global notify variables are
	  initialized to avoid problems with multi-threaded initialization
	  of these variables.

2012-06-16 09:08  robert

	* Fixed spelling of FileNameComparator

2012-06-15 09:04  robert

	* Moved the frame() event into the event traversal after then
	  events and their state have been accumulated.

2012-06-12 20:15  robert

	* Added FileNameComparator to sort the filenames in an
	  ImageSequence into alphanumerical order so that it can handle the

2012-06-12 18:29  robert

	* Enabled 6 ImageThreads in the ImagePager

2012-06-12 10:31  robert

	* Commented out the disabling of use of PBO's in ImageStream, and
	  disabled the use ClientStoreHint in Present3D.

2012-06-11 19:54  robert

	* Added support for setting the <image> paging_mode property to
	  PRE_LOAD_ALL_IMAGES, PAGE_AND_RETAIN_IMAGES or

	* Added typdef for Win32

2012-05-25 16:07  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "A very small but maybe fatal problem was found
	  when I saved models with shader and uniforms (with new double
	  types support) to osgb format and tried to read it again. The
	  application will crash here. And the serializer file should be
	  slightly changed to fix it. Please replace the original file in
	  osgWrappers/serializers/osg/Uniform.cpp."

2012-05-25 15:32  robert

	* Added Dragger::get/setActivationMouseButtonMask(uint).

2012-05-25 08:56  robert

	  constructor in TabPlaneDragger
	  and TabPlaneDragger.cpp:
	  
	  TabPlaneDragger(float handleScaleFactor=20.0f);
	  
	  The reason for this is that the default OSG tab sizes are way
	  bigger than
	  those we used in our application so far. And since
	  handleScaleFactor_
	  is already a (constant) class member, I see no objection against
	  making
	  it user defined."

2012-05-24 18:15  robert

	* From Jaap Gas, added missing break, and missing
	  removeDraggerCallback.

2012-05-21 09:12  robert

2012-04-20 10:01  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich,"Attached is a change to the ac3d model
	  loader as of rev 11498, that uses
	  indexed draws instead of plain array draws to save some amount of
	  main memory.
	  Draw performance does not change with the nvidia binary blob as
	  well as with
	  the open source drivers."

2012-04-20 09:53  robert

	* From John Kaniarz, "Here's a patch to add new extensions for
	  tessellation shaders to the GLSL
	  plugin." "I went with .tctrl and .teval for the shader
	  extensions."

2012-04-20 09:40  robert

	* Ran dos2unx on file

2012-04-20 09:38  robert

	* From John Kaniarz, "Here is an example of using tessellation

2012-04-19 10:27  robert

	* From David Callu, "Here the fix for Matrix{2,3,4}x{2,3,4}{fd}
	  defined in Uniform header.
	  
	  My previous patch for Atomic Counter Uniform provide new template
	  implementation
	  of Matrix{2,3,4}x{2,3,4}{fd}. This new implementation use
	  Column-Major Matrix.
	  Original code define matrix as Row-Major matrix like other Matrix
	  in OSG, and
	  my matrix implementation break compatibility with previous code.
	  For example osg_normalMatrix define in osg::State report by
	  Roland Hill.
	  Thanks to Paul Martz to spot me when the bug appear."

2012-04-19 10:10  robert

	* Added missing getUniformBlocks implmentation

2012-04-19 09:50  robert

	* From Jorge Izquierdo Ciges, "Mostly small changes to add more
	  compile options, and shared linking (still testing that
	  capability, but this enables on a compile basis if the user
	  wants). Robert, when you give the Ok I'll update/rewrite the
	  Android section in the old/new wiki you'll say where is better.
	  Mostly to be clear for the future users what options can
	  configure and what are their purpose."

2012-04-18 10:16  robert

	* Refactored the handling of GLES adaptations of the 1,2,3,4
	  internal formats and added handling of GL_RGB8_OES and
	  GL_RGBA8_OES.

2012-04-18 09:56  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a change to the slow path
	  geometry dispatch tables that allows the
	  use of 3 component float color vectors."

2012-04-18 09:51  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, "I have been experiencing a crash in the
	  example osgtexture2D.
	  Not sure why my system seems to be so sensitive to these
	  problems.
	  
	  But attached is a fix which seems to stabilise the example.
	  Note: it only seems to crash intermittently when spinning the
	  object with
	  your mouse.
	  
	  So I assume this is a threading issue because of the data
	  variance missing
	  in some of the text node setups in the example.
	  "

2012-04-18 09:50  robert

	* Updated version number

2012-04-06 11:29  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, Fix for MatrixTemplate compile errors

2012-04-05 13:53  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit the changes that will put
	  ObjectProperty and ObjectMark variables into the
	  InputStream/OutputStream class instead of static ones. This
	  should avoid the threading problem and won't repeatedly
	  reallocate memory for the properties. Some of the wrappers will
	  be slightly modified to use the property variable stored in the
	  InputStream/OutputStream as well."

2012-03-30 17:08  robert

2012-03-23 11:16  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "I've encoutered a nasty group of dae which
	  are incompatible with dae plugins (and probably collada schema )
	  in 4 different ways :
	  
	  1) they use direct link to texture
	  
	  -> this is already handle by current plugin : OK
	  
	  2) they defined colors with only 3 color components
	  
	  -> it leads to a crash when trying to acces to the fourth
	  component
	  I fixed that
	  
	  3) they contain empty primitive lists
	  
	  -> reading is ok, but osgviewer crashes when trying to display
	  the geometries
	  The reason is that osg assume that DrawElementsare never empty
	  (blunt acces to DrawElements.front() in PrimitiveSet.cpp)
	  I corrected this (on the plugin side), but I wonder :
	  Is it the responsability of plugins to create non empty
	  DrawElements, or of osg core not to crash when they occur ?
	  If the responsability is on the osg core side, I can submit a
	  patch to PrimitiveSet.cpp regarding that aspect.
	  
	  4) they use a material binding scheme not supported by the plugin
	  
	  ->I've implemented a mechanism to handle this binding scheme
	  
	  You will also find in the patch an example of these evil dae and
	  comments on the offending elements.
	  They seems to be produced by ComputaMaps (www.computamaps.com)
	  They load well in Google Earth

2012-03-23 10:24  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "as discussed on osg-users there is an
	  issue with clang++ on OS X and iOS that results in
	  the following error:
	  
	  Users/stephan/Documents/Projekte/cefix/cefix/ios/../../libs/ios/include/OpenThreads/Atomic:244:48:
	  error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'void *' with an
	  lvalue of
	  type 'const void *const'
	  return __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&_ptr, ptrOld, ptrNew);
	  
	  This can be solved by a cast to '(void*)ptrOld'. This should be
	  benign since both
	  'ptrOld' and 'ptrNew' are only read and the cast is in fact in
	  place for all other
	  implementations as well.
	  
	  On OS X the cast compiles cleanly on both g++
	  (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2 (GCC)
	  4.2.1) and clang++ (Apple clang version 3.1
	  (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.54)).

2012-03-23 10:21  robert

	* As per Ulrich Hertlrein's suggestion, changed
	  APPLE_PLATFORM_SDK_CANONICAL_NAME to OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME.

2012-03-23 10:18  robert

	* From Erik den Dekker, "
	  IF(${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL
	  "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk")
	  ...
	  
	  ELSEIF(${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL
	  "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk" OR ${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL
	  "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk")
	  
	  ...
	  
	  ELSEIF(EXISTS /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk)
	  ...
	  
	  ELSE()
	  
	  ...
	  
	  ENDIF()
	  
	  
	  Which is fragile because XCode could be installed into another
	  directory than /Developer. (In case XCode is not installed into
	  the /Developer directory CMake can automatically resolve the path
	  via command line utility ${CMAKE_XCODE_SELECT} --print-path)
	  
	  This issue bites me currently because the latest XCode (Version
	  4.3.1 - 4E1019) installed through the Mac App Store is per
	  default installed in "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer"
	  and hence the 10.7 SDK in
	  "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk"
	  
	  Searching the web to find the proper way to determine the version
	  of the Platform SDK programmatically, I found no standard way. I
	  came up with 2 options myself:
	  
	  1) Parse the path string to extract the version number
	  
	  2) Read a value from the SDKSettings.plist found in the root of
	  each SDK (e.g., "defaults read
	  ${CMAKE_OSX_ROOT}/SDKSettings.plist CanonicalName" gives
	  "macosx10.7")
	  
	  I implemented the last option and verified that at least the
	  following Mac OS SDKs (10.3.9, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7) support
	  this method. It also looks reasonably future proof. An additional
	  benefit of this method is that it also seems to be compatible
	  with iOS and iOS Simulator SDKs (at least for version 5.1, but I
	  assume this also applies to older versions). This is interesting
	  because the CMake infrastructure to build OSG for iOS currently
	  still contains similar hard-coded paths and even requires you to
	  manually change the cmake file to build for another iOS SDK
	  version. In the near future I hope to address these issues, but I
	  haven't been able to try this yet."

	* Fixed the order of setting of CenterMode

2012-03-14 16:42  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit a slightly modified version of
	  the ViewDependentShadowMap. It includes two fixes: one is in
	  ComputeLightSpaceBounds::update(), which changes the statement
	  "if (v.z()<0.0f)" to "if (v.z()<-1.0f)" as clipping space
	  coordinates should be transformed to [-1, 1] and should not be
	  discarded unless they go beyond the range; the other is in
	  ViewDependentShadowMap::computeShadowCameraSettings(), in which I
	  changed the line:
	  viewMatrix.makeLookAt(frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMin,
	  frustum.center, lightUp);
	  to
	  viewMatrix.makeLookAt(frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMin,
	  frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMax, lightUp);
	  
	  The reason I've done such a change is that for huge scenes like a
	  city on the earth, the values of frustum.center can be extremely
	  large, but zMin may be very small (e.g., when model depth in
	  light coords equals the model radius by chance) in some cases so
	  the result of (eye - center) might jiggle while moving around the
	  shadow scene and thus make the shadow map suddenly disappear some
	  time. The small change here also considers the effect of zMax to
	  avoid such problems.

	* From Chuck Seberino, "Attached are modified versions of

	  of _onCylinder / isProjectionOnCylinder().
	  
	  I have also made changes to the RotateCylinderDragger to provide
	  a cylinder ring with a thickness. It is totally optional, but
	  IMHO makes the default behavior work better than a solid cylinder

	* From Christian Buchner, "The attached openscenegraph example is
	  much simpler than
	  osgshaders.cpp and demonstrates the use of GLSL vertex and

	  shaders with a simple animation callback. I found the
	  osgshaders.cpp
	  too complex to serve as a starting point for GLSL programming"

2012-03-06 10:08  robert

	* From Chuck Seberino, "Here is a fix for the
	  RotateCylinderDragger. This patch fixes the case where the
	  picking direction is close to the cylinder axis. The current
	  behavior is this:
	  
	  * If the eyepoint and cylinder axis are close to parallel (given
	  some tolerance), then it uses a plane perpendicular to the
	  cylinder axis.
	  * Otherwise it uses a plane parallel to the cylinder axis
	  oriented towards the eyepoint (previous behavior). This gives
	  decent behavior and is the only path that was taken in the
	  previous code. I kept with previous behavior and that allowed a
	  good bit of code to be removed, simplifying things. There is now
	  no need for the _onCylinder flag, but since there is a public
	  accessor, I wasn't sure how to handle it for backwards
	  compatibility, so I left it in. NOTE - there is no default
	  initialized value, so if it is kept in, it should be set to
	  'false' to keep same behavior as before. I am not quite sure how
	  the _onCylinder case was supposed to behave as even forcing that
	  path gave undesirable behavior, even with carefully controlled
	  dragging.

	  - if no layer name was found, an empty string was used, with is

	  Autodesk DWG TrueView
	  - the plugin was writting polygons and triangles as LINE, as if
	  PolygonMode GL_LINE was active, and didn't use 3DFACE primitive.
	  I changed this behaviour to write 3DFACE as default, and LINE
	  when PolygonMode GL_LINE is active.

2012-02-28 12:03  robert

	* From Guillaume Millet, "When using the texture Atlas builder, it
	  will convert from REPEAT to
	  CLAMP all textures using only texcoord between [-0.001 1.001] to
	  give a
	  chance to create an Atlas.
	  If the atlas creation failed for other reason (texture size, only
	  one
	  compatible texture, ...) the texture remain modified in CLAMP
	  mode.
	  
	  But if you use texcoords between [0.0 1.0] using CLAMP mode
	  instead
	  REPEAT it is not safe because you will have a blend to the border
	  color
	  at extremities.
	  If we want to have exactly the same rendering after changing mode
	  from
	  REPEAT to CLAMP we should use the CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode instead of
	  CLAMP to
	  avoid blending to border color at extremities.
	  
	  Please find as attachment the proposed patch against latest svn

	  What's more I believe that it's correct to expect a floating

	* From Martin Lambers, "It adds a new ReaderWriter plugin for the

	  selected
	  with the COMPRESSION option of the plugin.

2012-02-10 17:20  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Upgrading to OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1, texture
	  mip mapping stopped
	  working on some junk low-end graphics cards which I still have to
	  support. They worked ok with osg 2.8 and earlier.
	  
	  The problem turned out to be with gl proxy textures, which are
	  unreliable on those devices. Proxy textures are used by the glu
	  mipmap build routines to determine if a texture size is
	  supported. The external glu library had a nice fallback
	  behaviour, so that if proxy textures didn't work then the mipmap
	  texture was still created. But in the work on the new embedded
	  glu routines that fallback behaviour has been inadvertently
	  lost. I have restored the fallback in
	  src/osg/glu/libutil/mipmap.cpp. It doesn't add any extra
	  complexity."

	* From Luc Frauciel, "osgUtil Tessellator : beginTessellation()
	  made virtual to allow configuration of tessellation:
	  
	  The initialisation of glu low level tessellator is done in
	  osgUtil::Tessellator::beginTessellation()
	  This function is not virtual, preventing any customization of the
	  tesselation.
	  In particular, there in an option in glu tesselator that force

	* From Martin von Gagern, "The xine osg plugin won't compile
	  against xine-lib-1.2.0:
	  
	  OpenSceneGraph-3.0.1/src/osgPlugins/xine/video_out_rgb.c:2772:25:

	  error: ?video_driver_class_t? has no member named
	  ?get_description?
	  
	  This has been reported on Gentoo: https://bugs.gentoo.org/397643
	  The relevant commit to the xine-lib repository is
	  http://anonscm.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib-1.2/diff/806b590a4d38/src/xine-engine/video_out.h
	  
	  This change addresses the issue. I'm sending the full modified
	  file as
	  an attachment. It is based on the 3.0.1 release of OSG. I'll also
	  paste
	  a diff below. You will find a colorized view in the Gentoo
	  bugzilla.
	  
	  The xine-lib API changed in the following way: the identifier and
	  description members are now "const char*" strings instead of
	  "char*
	  (*)(video_driver_class_t*)" getter function. As the functions in
	  the osg
	  plugin will always simply return a string literal, without
	  accessing
	  their argument, it is safe to simply call them with a NULL
	  argument and
	  use the returned string. This makes it easy to support both API
	  versions. When you drop support for older xine one day, you might
	  want
	  to move the string literals to the assignment, getting rid of the
	  functions in the process.
	  
	  The modified code compiles for me. I'm not sure how to test it,
	  as I've
	  only got OSG around in order to build (and hopefully one day even
	  use)
	  Flightgear.
	  
	  I'm assigning my copyright in this change to the osg project
	  leads.

2012-02-09 14:28  robert

	* Added back in support for checking the current working directory
	  by default, but now do the check
	  after the Options and Registry DataFilePathLists have been
	  checked, which will allow users to better control
	  over where files are searched for.

2012-02-09 14:11  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "This is a submission to fix a problem with
	  use of mode GL_RESCALE_NORMAL for geometries below a scaling
	  transform which is not equal in X, Y & Z components. In this
	  case, the 'slow' method of mode GL_NORMALIZE should be used to
	  perform the normalization.
	  
	  I have attached a correction to daeRTransforms.cpp based on trunk
	  at [12892] which corrects this problem.
	  
	  This is the changed section:
	  
	  Code:
	  if (scale.x() == scale.y() && scale.y() == scale.z())
	  {
	  // This mode may be quicker than GL_NORMALIZE, but ONLY works if

2012-02-09 12:50  robert

	* From Thorsten Brehm, "attached update changes OSG's
	  src/osgDB/Registry.cpp, so it doesn't (accidentally) resolve
	  relative paths against the current working directory when
	  searching for resources. So far, such paths were always resolved
	  against the cwd first.
	  
	  I guess the previous behaviour of giving the cwd precedence over
	  any path configured in the "database path list" (osgDB::Options)
	  wasn't intentional. Otherwise, if it was intentional after all,
	  it'd be good to add another feature instead, to make this
	  configurable - e.g. a flag in osgDB::Options to disable this, if
	  an application doesn't want the cwd being considered.
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, this submission will change the default
	  behaviour of searching for files so can potentially break
	  existing applications as it
	  won't search the current working direction unless it's included
	  in the DataFilePathList entry in the Options or Registy. I'll add
	  a follow
	  up submission to add back in this feature.

2012-02-08 17:12  robert

	* From Hartmut Seichter, "attached a revised CMakeLists.txt file
	  for Android that avoids the problems with a ARM gcc bug that
	  appears in the NDK. It only overrides the optimization level for
	  one file. As it resides only in the cfg parser this should not
	  have side effects on performance."

2012-02-08 10:50  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change clarifies the description for

2012-02-08 10:06  robert

	* From Leandro Motto Barros,
	  
	  "I've made a few changes to osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector so that
	  it
	  actually uses double precision floating point numbers everywhere
	  (as
	  long as OSG_USE_FLOAT_PLANE is not defined).
	  
	  I needed double precision intersections in a project I am working
	  on.
	  These changes fixed the problems I was having -- this is all
	  testing I
	  have done.
	  
	  Notice that I have changed
	  osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector::Intersection's members to use
	  doubles
	  (osg::Vec3d, instead of osg::Vec3). I could have added #ifdef's
	  there
	  too, but I think it is better to not change the types of stuff in
	  the
	  public interface depending on some preprocessor definition.
	  
	  The modified files are attached. A diff also follows, for those
	  who like it."
	  
	  With the following changes from Robert Osfield:
	  
	  "I've just reviewed your changes and have just tweaked them a
	  little to
	  streamline them. What I have done in the PolytopeIntersector
	  header
	  is add:
	  
	  typedef osg::Plane::Vec3_type Vec3_type;
	  
	  And then use this typedef in the definition of the vertices
	  rather
	  then Vec3d as you did. Next changes were to
	  PolytopeInteresector.cpp
	  where to the PolytopeIntersectorUtils defintions of the
	  Vec3_type, and
	  value_type which now simply read:
	  
	  typedef osg::Plane::Vec3_type Vec3_type;
	  typedef Vec3_type::value_type value_type;
	  
	  This way I was able to complete avoid any if def's and have
	  essential
	  the same implementation as you achieved. Changes now checked into
	  svn/trunk."

2012-02-08 09:34  robert

	* From Claus Scheiblauer, "in GraphicsWindowQt.cpp the
	  GLWidget::keyReleaseEvent was implemented slightly different to
	  the GLWidget::keyPressEvent, which caused the cursor keys values
	  to be not correctly mapped from an QKeyEvent value to an osg key
	  value when releasing a cursor key."

2012-02-07 16:14  robert

2012-02-07 12:02  robert

	* From Johannes Baeuerle, "The first problem is wrong value of the
	  block size of etc1 textures in the getCompressedSize call in
	  Texture.cpp. With the current block size of 16 the target
	  application crashes with a GL_INVALID_VALUE. The reason is that
	  the calculated size passed to OpenGL does not match the size of
	  the passed data(data pointer,texture width,texture height,spec of
	  etc1).
	  With a block size of 8 in the getCompressedSize call this error
	  dissapears."

2012-02-07 11:43  robert

2012-02-07 11:29  robert

	* From David Fries, "Of the two ways to use the Tessellator object,
	  only
	  retessellatePolygons was applying the winding and boundary
	  option.
	  Moved the gluTessProperty calls into beginTessellation().
	  
	  There's a comment typo fix, removing an unused VertexPointList
	  typedef, and allocates one _tobj instead of one per tesellation.
	  Protections were added to check that _tobj was allocated in the
	  few
	  remaining places it wasn't being checked.
	  
	  ---
	  On a side note, I would like to avoid the 'new Vec3d' in
	  Tessellator::addVertex for each call to
	  gluTessVertex(tess, location, data).
	  The RedBook leaves it ambiguous if the location pointer must
	  remain valid after gluTessVertex or not.
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/gluTessVertex.xml
	  says that changing location is not safe, so being conservative,
	  I'll
	  leave it as is, even though the Mesa GLU library copies the data
	  not
	  the pointer, so it is currently safe."

2012-02-07 11:21  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "The setNormal method of osg::Billboard has
	  side effects (it calls updateCache and update the normal to Z
	  rotation matrix). When cloning billboards, copying the normal
	  vector is not enough. In the correction, the copy constructor
	  calls setNormal to update the internal members."

2012-02-07 10:57  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "This is a one line modification of
	  StatsHandler.cpp to work correctly while dumping states to
	  console when ViewerStats getEarliesFrameNumber() and
	  getLatestFrameNumber() return zeroes. If that happened in current
	  version, printing loop was iterating between 0 and 0xFFFF FFFF
	  indices and that was hanging our system.

	  render on demand.
	  
	  "Currently issuing a mouse scroll DOWN event would stop updating

2012-02-07 10:33  robert

	* From Sukender, "I just fixed using UTF8 paths in JP2 readerwriter
	  under Windows. Jpeg2000 plugin could not handle UTF8 paths as it
	  was using an Japser open() function which seems to be based on
	  the standard fopen(). The fix simply opens the file beforehand
	  and only gives a FILE* to the Jasper lib (and then closes the
	  file, of course).
	  "

2012-02-06 13:45  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "In Optimizer.cpp a nodes update callback

2012-02-06 13:40  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a change to the stats

	  time and/or elapsed frames.
	  
	  
	  
	  I found that some of the items that had been paged in were being
	  expired on the first frame that they were not visible (as the
	  cache was full). This resulted in excessive paging every time the
	  view was moved. With the following changes I could only allow
	  children to be expired if they had not been used for e.g. 30
	  seconds or 60 frames."

2012-02-06 12:05  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a first version of
	  multi-touch-support for OS X (>=

	  After switching multi-touch-support on, all mouse-events from the

	  I think this is not a problem, as multi-touch-input is a
	  completely
	  different beast as a mouse, so you'll have to code your own

	  While coding this stuff, I asked myself if we should refactor

	  windows. They share GL objects
	  between the contexts, using the GraphicsContext::Traits
	  sharedContext
	  and setting the same contextID.
	  
	  When one of these shared contexts is closed,
	  GraphicsContext::close
	  deletes all GLObjects for that contextID, regardless of the fact
	  that
	  they are shared. This means that all of the other contexts
	  sharing the
	  objects have to recompile them.
	  
	  The attached tweak makes GraphicsContext::close a bit less brutal
	  for
	  shared contexts. I have also changed a misleading diagnostic
	  message.
	  "

2012-02-01 17:38  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "FBX plugin was locked on version 2012.1 of
	  FBX SDK which is not available anymore on Autodesk website.
	  This patch allows version of FBX >= 2012.1, which includes
	  current one : 2012.2
	  "

2012-02-01 17:16  robert

	* Renamed selection to transform to make it clear to understand
	  what is being done.

2012-02-01 17:10  robert

	* Added example usage of teh new DraggerTransforCallback's
	  HandleCommandMask which is tied to the TabPlaneDragger example.

2012-02-01 13:55  robert

	* Added DraggerTransformCallback::HandleCommandMask to
	  DraggerTransformCallback to allow applications to select which
	  commands they want the dragger callback to respond to why
	  updating the transform.

2012-01-31 10:56  robert

	* Improved the handling of osgManipulator::Constraint,
	  DraggerCallbacks and Command so that they now use a Visitor
	  Pattern
	  to ensure the correct methods on constraints and callbaks are
	  called for each Command. Also fixed the handling of
	  Constraints when applied to composite Draggers.

2012-01-30 12:26  robert

	* Added support for Scale1DDragger, Scale2DDragger and
	  TranslatePlaneDragger to --dragger command line option

2012-01-27 09:49  robert

	* From Kristofer Tingdahl, Added missing core OSG libraries.

2012-01-26 18:03  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "a recent submission added a 10.6-feature to
	  GraphicsWindowCocoa. I added
	  some ifdefs around, so it compiles again with 10.5 SDK"

2012-01-26 14:26  robert

	* Quietend down debug message

2012-01-26 13:08  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, "when switching from windowed mode to
	  fullscreen (with the 'f' key) in X11, no RESIZE event is
	  generated. This confuses handlers that perform some processing on
	  the RESIZE event, e.g. the InteractiveImageHandler.
	  
	  To reproduce the problem I attach a minimally modified osgviewer
	  that just prints resize events. You can check what's printed in
	  the console when you go fullscreen and windowed a few times.
	  
	  The attached version of GraphicsWindowX11 fixes the problem for
	  me, but I'm not sure this is the right approach. Maybe you can
	  see a fix for the problem clearer.
	  
	  The only place where the RESIZE event is generated in
	  GraphicsWindowX11 is in CheckEvents and it then depends on the
	  ConfigureNotify message. For some reason, either ConfigureNotify
	  is not sent when going fullscreen or the traits already reflect
	  the latest window size."

2012-01-25 17:37  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, "this fall-through had me scratching my head
	  for a while...
	  
	  It made InteractiveImageHandler eat keypresses outside its
	  image."

2012-01-25 17:35  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, "GraphicsWindowX11 typo, I believe X/Y's
	  should match."

2012-01-25 17:31  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "Ati FirePro is as much crippled as other Ati
	  drivers.
	  This patch add "FirePro" to the black list of renderers in
	  State.cpp / initializeExtensionProcs
	  
	  It allows to avoid an OpenGL error on Viewer initialization.
	  Tested on FirePro M7740 / Windows7 x64 Driver 8.85.7.2"

2012-01-25 15:38  robert

	* Changed the KeyEventToggleTexturing to 'e' to avoid conflict with
	  't' used for transparency.

2012-01-24 17:57  robert

	* Made the cursor state protected.

2012-01-24 17:49  robert

	* From Tobias Ottenweller, "this is a fix for the problem where all
	  input freezes for a quarter second when calling
	  requestWarpPointer under Mac OS X (described here:
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=3933 ).
	  
	  I used the latest version available via subversion.
	  
	  My fix is using some API only available on 10.4 and later. I used
	  some preprocessor statements to gain compatibility with 10.3 and
	  earlier using (now) deprecated API.
	  
	  Only tested on OS X Lion (10.7). Please do some testing as well
	  since I'm fairly new to OpenSceneGraph. Someone should also test
	  the code for 10.3 and earlier."

2012-01-24 17:47  robert

	* Fixed indentation and spaces at ends of lines.

2012-01-24 17:40  robert

	* From Paulk Martz, "Looks like the ClipNode::setReferenceFrame
	  comment block came from LightSource. Fixing the comment block to
	  refer to ClipNode instead of light source."

2012-01-24 17:38  robert

	* Chris Denham, fixed type of parameters to ensure they are longs
	  where appropriate.

2012-01-24 17:30  robert

	* Moved setEndBarrierOperation(..) implementation into .cpp and
	  added support for stoppig and starting threading if required.

2012-01-24 17:21  robert

	* From Paul Martz, Added ViewerBase::s/getEndBarrierOperation(..)
	  method to allow user control of how viewers are sync'd.

2012-01-24 15:44  robert

	* Fixed compile error

2012-01-24 14:34  robert

	* Added support for using GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH in conjunction with
	  texture's + osg::Image via new RowLength
	  parameter in osg::Image. To support this Image::setData(..) now
	  has a new optional rowLength parameter which
	  defaults to 0, which provides the original behaviour,
	  Image::setRowLength(int) and int Image::getRowLength() are also
	  provided.
	  
	  With the introduction of RowLength support in osg::Image it is
	  now possible to create a sub image where
	  the t size of the image are smaller than the row length, useful
	  for when you have a large image on the CPU
	  and which to use a small portion of it on the GPU. However, when
	  these sub images are created the data
	  within the image is no longer contiguous so data access can no
	  longer assume that all the data is in
	  one block. The new method Image::isDataContiguous() enables the
	  user to check whether the data is contiguous,
	  and if not one can either access the data row by row using
	  Image::data(column,row,image) accessor, or use the
	  new Image::DataIterator for stepping through each block on memory
	  assocatied with the image.
	  
	  To support the possibility of non contiguous osg::Image usage of
	  image objects has had to be updated to
	  check DataContiguous and handle the case or use access via the
	  DataIerator or by row by row. To achieve
	  this a relatively large number of files has had to be modified,
	  in particular the texture classes and
	  image plugins that doing writing.

2012-01-24 14:27  robert

	* Refactored the click_to_run implementation to avoid bug
	  associated with running the first click_to_run entry in a layer
	  when
	  subsequent click to run's are called.

2012-01-23 18:48  robert

	* Changed float QuicktimeImageStream::getCurrentTime() to double
	  QuicktimeImageStream::getCurrentTime() to keep it consistent with
	  the type of the virtual function ImageStream::getCurrentTime(),
	  and with this fixing a compile and runtime error.
	  
	  Changed time variables all to use doubles rather than float to be
	  consist with the change to getCurrentTime().

2012-01-05 14:07  robert

	* From Alberto Luacus, "The ffmpeg plugin fails to compile with the
	  upcoming libav 0.8 because
	  the required header mathematics.h is not being included
	  explicitly.
	  
	  I have just included it, and verified that this also works with
	  current
	  version 0.7, since the header is also available there."

2012-01-03 15:59  robert

	* Fixed the return value of SlideEventHandler::selectLayer() so
	  that the 'n' now works correctly.

2012-01-02 16:54  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Attached is a simple fix to osg::Sequence
	  that allows it to load properly with the serializer formats
	  (osgt/osgb). The problem was that the internal _nrepsRemain
	  member was not being initialized properly if the number of
	  repeats was equal to the default value of -1. When the number of
	  repeats is explicitly set using setNumRepeats(), _nrepsRemain is
	  set to the same value. However, in the constructor of
	  osg::Sequence, it was not being initialized to the same value as
	  _nreps. This fix simply changes the initial value of _nrepsRemain
	  to the same as _nreps."

2012-01-02 16:38  robert

	* From Chris Denham, Implementation of write functions in CURL
	  plugin

2011-12-23 17:40  robert

	* From Paul Martz and David Glenn,
	  
	  "From David Glenn and Paul Martz. This change adds support for
	  the NO_COLOR bit in the Vertex records' flags field. If NO_COLOR
	  is set, and PACKED_COLOR is not set, the code will now properly
	  default to using the face color at those vertices. See the
	  osg-users thread "Open Flight characteristic not reflected in the
	  current OSG" for more info."
	  
	  and
	  
	  "In consultation with David Glenn, it appears we needed to change
	  a second file to correct how OpenFlight handles transparency when
	  vertices have NO_COLOR. "

2011-12-23 17:34  robert

	* Gunnar Holm, "After upgrading from 2.8.3 to 3.0.1 we experienced
	  a lock in the Mutex
	  functionality when using Terrain::setVerticalScale. This was
	  caused by
	  the following call sequence resulting in a lockup:
	  
	  void Terrain::setVerticalScale(float scale)
	  CALLS dirtyRegisteredTiles();
	  
	  
	  void Terrain::dirtyRegisteredTiles(int dirtyMask)
	  SETS LOCK OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex>
	  lock(_mutex);

	  void TerrainTile::setDirtyMask(int dirtyMask)
	  CALLS _terrain->updateTerrainTileOnNextFrame(this);
	  
	  
	  void Terrain::updateTerrainTileOnNextFrame(TerrainTile*
	  terrainTile)
	  SETS LOCK OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex>
	  lock(_mutex);
	  ******* PROBLEM - since lock has already been set! ********
	  
	  
	  The suggested fix submitted changes from using Mutex to
	  ReentrantMutex.
	  "

2011-12-23 17:21  robert

	* From Aurelien Albert, "I made a modification in the Dragger class
	  :
	  
	  You can now set a "intersection mask" and it will be used when
	  looking for intersections.
	  
	  So you can now easily "hide" some objects from manipulators."

2011-12-23 17:16  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I have added an implementation for
	  set/getVolume in the direct show plug-in."

2011-12-23 16:57  robert

	* From James Turner, "Testing FlightGear with Cocoa osgViewer,
	  encountered some problems with hiding / re-showing the cursor.
	  Attached version fixes this, by tracking the current cursor
	  value, and ensuring we don't nest calls to [NSCursor hide] or
	  [NSCursor unhide]."

2011-12-23 16:29  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached is a patch for
	  osgPlugins/mdl/MDLReader.cpp that improves its functionality on
	  Unix filesystems. It also includes code cleanups/refactoring."

2011-12-23 16:27  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "Attached are some small changes to the
	  ImageStream interface and the DirectShow and FFMPEG plugins to
	  provide the current time being displayed in the image stream.
	  I don’t have access to an OSX or Linux dev machine to make the
	  changes required to the quick time plugin. This plugin will just
	  default to returning 0."

	  #define-guard."

2011-11-01 13:36  robert

	* Added screen capture handler to present3D, with the PrtScn button

	* Add catch for when shadows are enabled between the update and
	  draw traversals.

2011-10-03 15:25  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, changed the border colour for the
	  shadow map to be 1 rather the 0 used for debugging so that areas
	  outside the shadow map default to being unshadowed rather than
	  shadowed.
	  changed the shadow map texture assigment to StateSet so that it
	  doesn't use OVERRIDE, enabling subgraphs to use the same texture
	  unit for other textures if they so required.
	  tidied up indentation.

2011-10-03 14:57  robert

	* Changed getVertical(..) so it uses the same coord scale as the

2011-09-28 10:54  robert

	* Added computation of the extents, in light space, of the shadow
	  maps RenderStage contents and use of this to produce a tighter
	  bound light space projection.

2011-09-20 11:46  robert

	* Added a half second sleep after calling system command when the

2011-09-20 10:59  robert

	* Added better error reporting and handling when <key> tag contents
	  are not valid.

2011-09-20 10:01  robert

	* Added handling of <!DOCTYPE...> tag and "" options.

2011-09-19 10:42  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached is a patch that cleans up
	  compiler warnings and common functionality."

2011-09-19 10:39  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "There was a bug in reading modifier
	  keys when focus to GraphicsWindowWin32 was restored. Handler of
	  WM_SETFOCUS was reading pressed keys and sending WM_KEYDOWN
	  messages to fill initial keyboard state. But WM_KEYDOWN messages
	  sent had 0 on lParam and adaptKey method computing state of
	  modifier mask was using lParam to find which modifier keys are
	  down. Obviously when lParam was 0 it was not recording proper
	  modifier masks.
	  
	  This patch fixes this code sending proper lParam and also makes
	  sure LEFT_CONTROL will be not confused with RIGHT_CONTROL."

2011-09-19 10:34  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "You'll find attached a new option that allow,
	  when using LOD in USER_DEFINED_CENTER mode to expand the radius
	  of the node by the radius of loaded objets.
	  Motivation ;
	  When using PagedLODs, you don't always know the real size of
	  loaded children,
	  If it occurs that they are out of predefined bounds, picking on
	  the parts that are out of bound will fail
	  They also can be culled out too soon.
	  The problem often occurs with long object (roads).
	  I've modified LOD and ProxyNode to include this option."
	  
	  and later email:
	  
	  "Attached the UNION_OF_BOUNDING_SPHERE_AND_USER_DEFINED version
	  There are impacts on some serializers (dae, osgWrapper).
	  I haven't modified deprecated osg, since it's deprecated"

2011-09-19 10:12  robert

	* Added removal of [..] from names returned from glGetActiveUniform
	  results to avoid issues with name lookups when the driver add the
	  [..] for uniform arrays.

2011-09-19 09:44  robert

	* Copya and Paste Anti-Pattern strikes again! Renamed FreeType
	  usage to Revisions to correct previous mistake when copying and
	  modifying the ReaderWriter.

2011-09-14 10:45  robert

	* Fixed memory leak

2011-09-14 10:22  robert

	* Added missing forward declaration

2011-09-14 10:02  robert

	* Added asCamera() methods into osg::Camera and osg::Node

2011-09-14 09:49  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "attached is a zipped
	  OpenSceneGraph\src\osgPlugins\ffmpeg\FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp
	  
	  It solves a wrong sample format being set for audiostreams type
	  S32 and F32, for the
	  enum AVSampleFormat (in include/avutil/samplefmt.h) doesn't match
	  enum SampleFormat (in include/osg/AudioStream) for anything but
	  SAMPLE_FORMAT_U8 and SAMPLE_FORMAT_S16
	  "
	  
	  and follow up that address versioning issue
	  
	  "I can find the change, avutil version 50.38.0 introduced a new
	  header file:
	  libavutil/samplefmt.h
	  older versions use
	  libavcodec/avcodec.h
	  with the sampleformats without AV_
	  
	  an intermideate fix with the FF_API_OLD_SAMPLE_FMT is removed
	  from ffmpeg 0.8.3 so
	  I think this is the correct fix:
	  
	  #if LIBAVUTIL_VERSION_INT < AV_VERSION_INT(50,38,0)
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_NONE SAMPLE_FMT_NONE
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_U8 SAMPLE_FMT_U8
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_S16 SAMPLE_FMT_S16
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_S32 SAMPLE_FMT_S32
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_FLT SAMPLE_FMT_FLT
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_DBL SAMPLE_FMT_DBL
	  #define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_NB SAMPLE_FMT_NB
	  #endif
	  "

2011-09-13 13:38  robert

	* From Morten Hauknes, "I have been using the
	  getLastVisiblePixelCount on pre 3.0 osg. I believe maybe this was
	  a private function that we made public in our side. I use(d) this
	  method to make a simple algorithm to tell how much visible an
	  object was in percent.
	  
	  So with the 3.0 api change we propose the following change:
	  - put OSG_EXPORT on the QueryGeometry class so that we get access
	  to the getNumPixels method.
	  - Create a function called getQueryGeometry that returns a casted
	  _queryGeode->getDrawable(). Or a function called getQueryGeode
	  that returns _queryGeode."

2011-09-13 13:33  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, removed unneccessary BUILD_QT_EXAMPLES
	  cmake option

2011-09-13 11:48  robert

	* From Sukender, "I just fount that writing double precision values
	  (eg. Vec3dArray for vertices) works with .osg but not
	  .osgt/.osgx. So here is the fix (SVN trunk r12712). I suppose
	  .osgb works as expected on this point and did not change
	  anything.
	  So, as for .osg, if you add "precision 16" (for instance) to the
	  optionString, then you'll get double precision vertices written
	  correctly.
	  "

2011-09-13 11:09  robert

	* From Robert Milharcic, "This will hopefully fix some issues with
	  osgQt, more precisely with GLWidget event handling. There are at
	  least two current GL context braking events, QEvent::Hide and
	  QEvent::ParentChange. When running in a multithreaded mode they
	  both try to change current GL context in a wrong thread (main GUI
	  thread). The QEvent::ParentChange is also problematic when
	  running in a single threaded model because Qt is going to release
	  current contex then delete it, and then it will create new one,
	  and as a result the osg will continue to render to an invalid
	  deleted context. This changes workaround above problems by
	  deferring execution of the problematic evens. These events has to
	  be enqueued and executed later. The enqueued event processing is
	  currently done right after swap in a swapBuffersImplementation of
	  GraphicsWindowQt while code is running in a render thread by
	  calling QGLWidget handler directly. In principle the deferred
	  events queue should be executed while in GUI thread but I
	  couldn't find any reliable way to do this, that is without
	  risking a deadlock. For now it is assumed, Qt is not going to
	  execute any GUI thread only operations inside the QGLWidget
	  handler."

2011-09-13 10:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "
	  The osgUtil::CullVisitor class will display an OSG_INFO
	  notification when attempting to clamp the projection matrix with
	  invalid near/var values. This usually appears when the scene
	  graph is empty or all objects are culled. I don't think this
	  scenario warrants having this message appear every frame. It
	  makes it very difficult to debug other issues when this
	  notification floods the output window.
	  
	  I'd prefer to have the notification removed, but there might be
	  legitimate cases where you want this displayed. Instead, I just
	  disabled the output if the near/far values are equal to FLT_MAX
	  (their initial values). This should at least prevent the
	  notification for the common case where everything was culled."

2011-09-13 09:59  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's my proposed change regarding the
	  osg-users post "small feature culling threshold". I've updated
	  the comments and brought the default values into agreement, but
	  didn't bother to add the environment variable support."

2011-09-13 09:53  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I added a simple setting in OSG's
	  CMakeLists.txt to be able to disable building anything related to
	  Qt. It just skips the FindPackage(...) for Qt3 and Qt4, so since
	  they are not found nothing related to Qt will be generated by
	  CMake. The default is to build the Qt related stuff, so current
	  behavior is unchanged."

2011-09-13 09:46  robert

	* From Sukender, "I added a tiny check to avoid an integer
	  divide-by-zero, when image is invalid (ie. all values are 0)."

2011-09-13 09:43  robert

	* From Sukender, "I added a crash-guard against corrupted 3DS
	  files, having faces indexes out of the range of existing
	  vertices."

2011-09-13 09:21  robert

	* From Farshild Lashkari, "Attached is a simple patch that avoids
	  the depth write pass in Text::renderWithDelayedDepthWrites if the
	  current osg::State object has GL_DEPTH_TEST disabled."

2011-09-13 09:17  robert

	* Reverted Paul Idstein warning fix as this was breaking the build

2011-09-12 16:24  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, Added some error checks and memory cleanup.

2011-09-12 16:20  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, fixed build for OSX 10.6 and earlier

2011-09-12 16:17  robert

	* From Johannes Baeuerle, opptimization of ES support of
	  osg/BufferObject

2011-09-12 12:38  robert

	* From Bjorn Blissing, "Found a minor (probably a copy & paste) bug
	  in ViewerEventHandlers.
	  Line 251:
	  int getKeyEventWindowedResolutionDown() const { return

2011-09-12 12:26  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "When osgUtil::DelaunayTriangulator
	  triangulate() function ends with no triangle generated, it
	  crashes.
	  This patch fixes that"

2011-09-12 12:14  robert

2011-09-12 11:28  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, from three submissions:
	  
	  "Here a patch that correct like the previous assign collada
	  material name
	  to stateset."
	  
	  and
	  
	  "I changed how the collada reader set object name in osg. Current
	  implementation use collada ID to setup name. with this patch I
	  use
	  collada name to setup name in osg object and if collada provide
	  no name
	  I use as fallback ID. I am not sure we want this fallback.
	  
	  The motivation of this change is that when an artist set names to
	  its
	  objects and export to collada, I am not able to use those names
	  in osg
	  to retrieve the node."
	  
	  and
	  
	  "Here the update of the file that fix the light id stuff"

	* From Magnus Kessler, typo fixes

2011-09-12 10:47  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've encountered a strange problem that
	  osgviewerMFC doesn't work well
	  with the StatsHandler. When the 's' key is pressed, the rendering
	  window will be halted. I tried solving the problem by commenting
	  a
	  line in CMFC_OSG_MDIView::OnKeyDown() and it seems to work now.
	  
	  Another improvement here is to use a thread class derived from
	  OpenThreads to replace the old _beginthread(). It helps a lot in
	  keeping a high frame rate when you open more than one MDI child
	  windows. And the application using OpenThreads in my opinion will
	  be
	  more compatible and portable."

2011-09-12 10:46  robert

	* Updated SO version number to 90 to allow for recent changes to
	  the ABI, and to set the base for the 3.1.0 series.

2011-09-12 10:43  robert

	* From Sukender, "I added private constructors to osg::ValueObject
	  & TemplatedValueObject, to avoid allocation on the stack and ugly
	  things like:
	  TemplatedValueObject<int> value(....);
	  container->addUserObject(value);"

2011-09-07 20:05  robert

	* Added handling the ShadowSettings::LightNum for selecting which
	  light to use.

2011-09-07 16:26  robert

	* Added handling of the case when RenderLeaf::_modelview matrix is
	  NULL, such as when LightPointNode is used in the scene graph.

2011-09-07 15:55  robert

	* Moved ViewDependetShadowMap parameter settings into a dedicated
	  ShadowSettings object in prep for making it possible to scale the
	  API to handle multiple lights and multiple shadow maps per light.

2011-09-06 17:26  robert

	* Added setting of the shadow map Camera's name to "ShadowCamera"
	  to improve integration with osgOcean.

2011-09-06 11:11  robert

	* Fixed the heights of the trees and houses

2011-09-06 10:12  robert

	  the light and view directions are co-incident.

2011-09-05 12:36  robert

	* Added support for setting whether ViewDependentShadowMap should
	  provide it's own vertex and fragment shaders.

2011-09-01 18:49  robert

	* Added test line for COMPUTE_NEAR_USING_PRIMITIVES

2011-09-01 18:48  robert

	* Added fine grained computation of the far plane when using the
	  COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR_USING_PRIMITIVES ComputeNearFarMode.
	  Added COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR_USING_PRIMITIVES option that provides the
	  original functionality where only the near plane
	  is computed in a fine grained way, with the far plane being
	  computed simply from bound volumes.

2011-08-29 16:01  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin, build fix

2011-08-29 10:26  robert

2011-08-24 19:38  robert

	* Added support for user defined setting of the shadow texture unit

2011-08-24 13:57  robert

	* Changed new ViewDependentShadowMap to default to a perspective
	  shadow map with automatic detection of a spot light/perspetive
	  light projection
	  matrix to prevent inappropriate usage of perspective shadow map.

2011-08-24 12:32  robert

	* Imorovements to the new perspective/lispsm style shadow

	  Attached is a fix. "

2011-08-12 20:29  robert

	* Added public interface for selecting use of perspective and light
	  space perspective shadow maps. Implementation
	  of backends not implemented yet so will follow.

2011-08-12 14:53  robert

	* Implemented first pass at shaders for new ViewDepedentShadow map
	  class

2011-08-09 15:57  robert

	  standard --debugHUD option.

2011-08-09 15:20  robert

	* Changed RTT Camera to use depth.

2011-08-09 13:39  robert

	* Implemented caching of Camera, Texture and TexGen

2011-08-09 06:54  robert

	* Added replacement of the placeholder StateSet in the StateGraph

2011-08-08 17:00  robert

	* Further work on basic ViewDependentShadowMaps, adding
	  implementation of RTT camera and texgen setup.

2011-08-07 15:54  robert

	* From Jean-Sebestien Guay and Robert Osfield, mixture of two sets
	  of change - one from JS that adds more controls for specifying
	  positional and spot lights, and from RO adding support for the
	  new ViewDepedentShadowMap

2011-08-07 15:51  robert

	* Preliminary work on new ViewDependentShadowMap base class

2011-07-29 11:22  robert

	* Commented out the colorAmbientEmissive +=
	  gl_FrontLightProduct[0].ambient; line from the fragment shader as
	  it was
	  causing problems with the shadowed region being sporadically lit
	  when using a spotlight.

2011-07-29 07:42  robert

	* Fixed comment on end barrier position.

2011-07-28 16:40  robert

	* Improved handling of the scaling of dicom imagery.

2011-07-28 12:07  robert

	* Refectored the EGL setup so that it's honours the Traits values.

2011-07-28 11:05  robert

	* Reverted the change to the default setting of
	  _resizeNonPowerOfTwoHint back to true for all platforms to ensure
	  the
	  same behaivour across platforms, something that can be achieved
	  now thanks to the integrated GLU library.
	  
	  Corrected the default of the ResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint to true to
	  reflect the actual default setting set by the
	  Texture default constructor.

2011-07-28 08:19  robert

	* From Johannes Baeuerle, "in the file src/osgDB/ObjectWrapper.cpp,
	  where the GlobalLookupTable for gl enums for serialization
	  purposes is defined, some of the compressed texture formats are
	  missing. I added enums for the pvr and etc formats."

2011-07-28 07:46  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a small fix for
	  getCameraContainingPosition. getXMin was
	  being used in a case where getYMin should be used instead."
	  

2011-07-25 17:07  robert

	* Fixed stats bug where not all stats fields were being collected
	  by the cull_draw() method used in the SingleThreaded and
	  CullDrawThreadPerContext threading models.

2011-07-22 09:27  robert

	* From Alexander Irion, "Texture borders are not supported in ES.
	  
	  _isTextureBorderClampSupported is set to "TRUE" in Texture.cpp,
	  because of the version number check (GL VERSION >= 1.3).
	  
	  This leads to an invalid enum error, when GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR
	  is tried to set.
	  "

2011-07-22 08:25  robert

	* In the RecordCameraPathhandler fixed the handling of pressing 'Z'
	  before 'z' which was causing the view
	  to be reset to 0,0,0 by AnimationPathManipualtor with an empty
	  AnimationPath.

2011-07-21 09:55  robert

	* Fixed typo

2011-07-21 09:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have attached an updated version of
	  the VRML2 loader.
	  That change is the result of the '[osgPlugins] VRML plugin -
	  "file" url'
	  discussion on osg-users.
	  
	  The attached change avoids rewriting file names into some kind of
	  file urls
	  and then use the url for opening an fstream. Instead just use the
	  given file
	  name to open the stream.
	  Also this change adds some Notify output for the error paths.
	  "

2011-07-21 08:52  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "This fixes a small problem in the FindFBX file.
	  In CMake scripts,
	  VS2010 is not marked as MSVC100 but MSVC10. And CMake defines
	  MSVC_VERSION instead of MSVC_VER to indicate the version number.
	  The
	  modification can find fbx sdk for VS2010 automatically now.
	  "

2011-07-20 10:17  robert

	* From Claus Scheiblauer, fixed handling of horizontal mouse wheel
	  events.

2011-07-20 09:10  robert

	* Introduced workaround for problem of text that is scaled in
	  screen coords, but hasn't been rendered yet
	  so doesn't have knowledge of screen space yet, so assume that
	  scaling is 1 rather than 0 as was previously
	  assumed in the previous handling of screen space text.

2011-07-18 12:41  robert

	* Added doxygen comments explaining read file callback
	  functionality.

2011-07-18 09:40  robert

	* Changed the HAVE_CONFIG_H guard so that it uses #ifndef _MSC_VER
	  rather than _WIN32 to avoid problems with Mingw and Cygwin builds
	  of DCMTK.

2011-07-17 16:24  robert

	* From Alberto Luacas, typo fixes

2011-07-17 10:30  robert

	* From Wang Rui, improved the handling of the _preReadString within
	  the readWrappedString method by factoring the
	  reading of the next character into a dedicated getCharacter(..)
	  method.

2011-07-15 10:24  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've found that the latest ffmpeg made some
	  functions and macros
	  deprecated, which led to compilation errors in the OSG plugin. I
	  tried
	  fixing them and tested with the version ffmpeg-git-5d4fd1d
	  (ffmpeg
	  version > 0.8, libavcodec = 53.7.0) under Windows.
	  "

2011-07-15 10:22  cedricpinson

2011-07-15 09:14  robert

	* From Wang Rui,"The files attached should be separately put into
	  the directories
	  src/osgPlugins/osg and src/osgWrappers/serializers/osgSim. They
	  fix a
	  serious infinite loop problem that may be caused by the stream
	  buffer
	  mechanism under Windows and some osgSim wrapper bugs pointed by
	  Andreas. I've asked the community to help test them and hope now
	  we
	  can solve these recent .osgt file reading issues."

2011-07-15 08:43  robert

	* From Ryan Pavlik, "Fix inventor state copy constructor.

	* From Philip Lamp, submitted by Stephan Huber, "Modify the
	  ReaderWriteImageIO_IOS to correctly handle relative paths
	  when reading from a file. This means that no longer do all image
	  files
	  have to live at the root of the Resources folder inside the app
	  bundle,
	  but can now be organized inside folders. Also improved error
	  handling
	  and fixed a potential leak of a CGColorSpaceRef each once per
	  image load."

	* From Wang Rui, "I've found a small problem which causes crashes
	  in the 3ds plugin
	  while trying to load a model. The fix here will ensure that the

	* Added better handling of archives in ReaderWriterZip::readNode()
	  so that if there is no master file definition it
	  loads all the available nodes in the zip archive and returns an
	  osg::Group containing all the nodes if there is more
	  than one, or just returns the node if there is just one. Also
	  implemented this functionality for ReaderWriterZip::readImage().

	* Fixed regression in --run-on-demand feature

2011-06-21 17:26  robert

	* Removed assert() that always evaluated to true.

	* From Torben Dannhauer, "originally I posted the addendum of
	  'freetype244MT', but that was wrong.
	  I updated it to the correct addendum of 'freetype244' yesterday,
	  but supposedly that was not forwarded to you by the
	  forum-to-mail-gateway.
	  
	  Find attached the corrected CMake module. "

2011-06-21 10:15  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2011-06-21 09:54  robert

	* Added returns to end of files

2011-06-21 09:54  robert

	* Added return to end of file

2011-06-21 09:53  robert

	* Conveted tabs to four spaces and added a return to end of file

2011-06-21 09:29  mplatings

	* Fixed redundant "enumeration not handled in switch" warnings.
	  Fixed a warning about a comparison between different enums -
	  EUnifiedMappingType was being compared with EMappingType. In
	  general the FBX SDK is moving away from Get & Set functions to
	  giving direct access to properties, so I have changed
	  GetMappingType() to CurrentMappingType.Get()

2011-06-21 09:00  robert

	* Disabled VisualStudio warning warning C4611: interaction between
	  '_setjmp' and C++ object destruction is non-portable

	* From Farshid Lashkari, BGR write support for BMP, PNG and TGA

2011-06-20 11:25  robert

	* Added catch for window manager doesn't set the window size to
	  full screen.

2011-06-20 09:28  robert

	* Added check against Traits::overrideRedirct to prevent the
	  fullscreen workaround being run when overrideRedirect
	  is on as overrideRedirect switches off the window managers
	  ability to manage the fullscreen so the problem doesn't
	  need working around.

2011-06-20 09:22  robert

	* Introduced a workaround for fullscreen toggle issues under modern
	  X11 window managers.

2011-06-20 09:20  robert

	* Added sleep before window resizing to make it less likely that
	  the previous frames rendering traversal is still
	  running when the window(s) is resized, something that creates
	  what looks like a glitch in rendering.

	* From John Cummings, "While testing recent OSG developer releases
	  and the subversion trunk, I
	  have noticed that on my 64-bit Linux machines, all of the OSG
	  libraries
	  get installed into the "lib64" directory as I would expect.
	  However, the
	  OpenThreads library gets installed into the "lib" directory when
	  selecting "Build OpenThreads with Qt threading support." That is,
	  with
	  the BUILD_OPENTHREADS_WITH_QT set to ON.
	  
	  I am attaching the a fix for this issue in the file:
	  
	  src/OpenThreads/qt/CMakeLists.txt
	  
	  It simply adds ${LIB_POSTFIX} to the destination as in done with
	  all
	  other CMakeLists.txt with libraries in OSG. I have tested it on
	  both
	  32-bit and 64-bit Linux."

	* From Jorge Ciges, "two clean example viewers (GLES1/2) that
	  permit load models withouth recompiling by options in the menu
	  and some basic options. basic options.
	  
	  As Rafa and I told you earlier this can't be integrated in the
	  CMAKE chain. It needs to be compiled by the user out of the OSG
	  standard compilation. It could be stored in the examples. That
	  way users will not come here asking for the examples.
	  
	  Main characteristics are:
	  
	  -Menu with loading and unloading by path.
	  -Return to home view
	  -Keyboard capabilities with manipilator switch and basic state
	  changing.
	  -Change color screen.
	  -Osg log bypassed to LogCat (This comes practically straight from
	  Marcin Hajder example I've only added personal TAG)
	  -Earmbi / Earmbi V7
	  -Install to SD (if the device supports the feature)
	  
	  And that's all. Now I'm looking to fix the environmental mapping
	  with true GLES (it does not work well in Android) I will try to
	  make it in time for 3.0. The other work that i'm studying Dynamic
	  build with Android but that will need a lot of time to test.

2011-06-09 12:57  robert

	* Refactored the UserDataContainer so that the
	  osg::UserDataContainer is now a pure virtual base class,
	  with a osg::DefaultUserDataContainer subclassed from this. The
	  user object access methods have now all
	  been moved from osg::Object into the UserDataContainer class,
	  except for the set/getUserData() methods
	  that are left in osg::Object for backwards compatibility, and the
	  description list access methods have
	  been moved back into osg::Node.
	  
	  main UserObject access methods are now all def

2011-06-09 11:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "the attached patch adds an additional
	  null pointer check"

2011-06-09 11:05  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "The attached patch adds the polygon
	  primitive to the TangentSpace computation.
	  As far as I understand, this should just work for the polygon as
	  well as with
	  the tristrip primitive.
	  "

2011-06-09 10:48  robert

	* Changed the defaults volume setting to not enable the
	  SampleDensityWhenMoving property.

2011-06-07 15:33  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS file for release

2011-06-07 14:28  robert

	* From Sukender, "Lastest change (update to FBX 2012.1) introduced
	  a regression. It didn't take materials' order into consideration.
	  The line
	  lMaterialLayer->GetDirectArray().SetAt(it->second.getIndex(),
	  lMaterial);
	  has been replaced by
	  _curFbxNode->AddMaterial(lMaterial);
	  because KFbxLayerElementMaterial::GetDirectArray() is now private
	  and we can't access to it.
	  However, pushing back the material at the end of the vector is
	  wrong.
	  We can use the (now) public attribute
	  KFbxLayerElementMaterial::mDirectArray, as in this submission.
	  "

2011-06-07 14:26  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, build fixes for legacy unix systems

2011-06-07 13:02  robert

2011-06-06 11:48  robert

	* From Frida Schlaug, "Imageio for ios had a poorly implemented
	  function for reading from streams (always returning null). In
	  this patch I copied some code from the non-ios imageio file and
	  adjusted it to work on ios. "

2011-06-06 11:45  robert

	  The fix was to simply move the setting of the thread that has
	  done the makeCurrent to right before the makeCurrent()
	  rather than right after.

2011-05-30 08:26  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The submission fixes the spelling bug we
	  discussed in osg-users. It
	  replaces the variable ACTUAL_3DPARTY_DIR to ACTUAL_3RDPARTY_DIR
	  with
	  back compatibility. Please find it in attachment.
	  "

2011-05-30 08:24  robert

2011-05-27 16:04  robert

	* Reverted part of revision r12294 that introduced threading
	  related problems under X11 due to checking the _display
	  Display member variable assigned to the graphics thread from the
	  main thread.

2011-05-27 11:22  robert

	* From Ryan Pavlik, "Existing osgconv behavior is to transform the
	  model bounding sphere center to the world origin before
	  performing transformations specified on the command line, and
	  translating back after rotation and scaling unless an alternate
	  translation is specified. This patch adds a setting to the
	  OrientationConverter class in osgconv to disable this extra
	  transformation, which has the effect of applying specified
	  transforms with respect to the input world coordinate system,
	  rather than to the center of the bounding sphere. It also adds a
	  command line argument "--use-world-frame" to enable this
	  behavior. When this command line argument is not passed, behavior
	  is unchanged from before the patch. The usage text has been
	  updated to reflect this additional option, and the comments in
	  OrientationConverter are also updated."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, tweaked the OrientationConverter.cpp a
	  little to improve readability.

2011-05-27 11:18  robert

	* Fixed indentation

2011-05-27 11:07  robert

	* Fixed the searchAndReplace function so that it correctly skips
	  over the newly inserted replacement strings.

2011-05-27 09:08  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I like the recent addition that adds
	  folders in the solution tree to better organize the numerous
	  examples, libraries, plugins etc.
	  
	  I added two folders that were missing IMHO: packaging and
	  documentation.
	  "

2011-05-27 09:05  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "Attached is an updated PNM plugin for
	  inclusion in both the trunk and for release version 2.8.5. The
	  attached file fixes numerous bugs in reading 8-bit and 16-bit
	  images, including loading the images upside-down. This file also
	  incorporates trunk patch r12220 which updated the plugin for
	  reading and writing images through streams instead of C-style
	  FILE I/O."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, previous revision was in error due to
	  an incomplete merge, this revision completes the job.

2011-05-27 09:00  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "While working on the osg exporter for
	  3dsmax I found a bug in the TriStripVisitor. I created a small
	  example (attached), and a modified version of
	  src\osgUtil\TriStripVisitor.cpp where the problem is removed."

2011-05-27 08:55  robert

2011-05-26 16:52  robert

	* Form Jorge Ciges, improved GL version detection code.

2011-05-26 16:34  robert

	* From Dietmar Funck, "I've noticed an issue when writing arrays of
	  type Vec2D and Vec3D to a .osgb file. A number is written to the
	  output stream to identify the array type. In case of Vec2D and
	  Vec3D arrays Vec4D is written as array type - I guess this is a
	  copy and paste mistake.
	  Writing the correct array types fixes the issue - in my case it
	  fixes writing and afterwards reading geometry instances."

2011-05-26 16:26  robert

	* From Bryce Eldridge, "Here is an update for the TIFF plugin that
	  includes the following features when writing out TIFF files:
	  
	  - Support for writing unsigned 16-bit images (GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT)
	  - Code to parse the options string for the following options:
	  -- Flag to turn off the compression. The PACKBITS compression
	  type causes issues for me with some programs on Windows (Picasa
	  for example).
	  -- Options to set the XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION tags (DPI) in
	  the TIFF file.
	  
	  Existing behavior (PACKBITS compression, DPI tags left at
	  default) is preserved if the options string is not set.
	  "

2011-05-26 16:19  robert

	* Fixed default setting of texture_no_tile to match the flags seet
	  in lib3ds_material.cpp initialize_texture_map(..).

2011-05-26 16:16  robert

	* From Oliver Neumann,
	  
	  "I checked your solution and found one missing point which makes
	  it still produce the tif error:
	  The very first seek_set on the empty stream with zero offset."
	  
	  "This means that the empty stream is seeked again resulting in
	  the fail bit to be set. Your code does not check this case,
	  furthermore you use t_off instead of std::ostream::streampos for
	  the tellp() calls. In this special case (empty stream) tellp()
	  returns -1 which is cast to 0xFFFFFFFFFF as t_off is unsigned. I
	  suggest this addition to your code (within the switch statement)"

2011-05-26 16:13  robert

	* Fixed indentation

2011-05-26 15:47  robert

	* Fixed handling of changes in gl buffer object size so that when a
	  gl buffer object is resized all the buffer data
	  is recompiled.

2011-05-25 12:41  robert

	* From Bradley Anderegg, "Ok, I am re-submitting this with the
	  changes we discussed. That is, there is a default implementation
	  of osgDB::Archive::getDirectoryContents() that uses
	  getFileNames(), and the osgDB::ArchiveExtended header was removed
	  as it is now unnecessary.
	  
	  Here is a quick list of the modified files:
	  
	  Archive - getDirectoryContents() no longer pure virtual
	  Archive.cpp - default getDirectoryContents() implementation
	  unzip.cpp - modified to fix a bug where the same file will not
	  load twice in a row
	  ZipArchive.h / ZipArchive.cpp - extends osgDB::Archive and
	  provides support for random access loading within a .zip file
	  ReaderWriterZip.cpp - modified to use the ZipArchive class"

2011-05-24 13:05  robert

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "build out-of-the box on MacOSX. The default
	  windowing system is carbon and it needs the AGL OpenGL Windowing
	  binding framework, which is missing. osgViewer does not link
	  therefore. Cocoa does not use AGL.
	  
	  The fix adds the AGL Framework to the Carbon link line for
	  osgViewer"

2011-05-24 10:20  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "proposed changes allows the user to add a
	  osgGraphicsWindowIOS as an
	  UIView, respecting the sizes via GraphicsContext::Traits.
	  This helps users, who want to integrate osg into an existing
	  ios-app
	  with multiple UIViews. Additinally a view-controller gets only
	  created
	  if needed, set IGNORE_ORIENTATION via the WindowData-struct.
	  "

2011-05-16 10:07  robert

	* From Sukender, I wrapped my change about non-empty texture units
	  in an off-by-default option, so that it doesn't break any
	  existing code. But AFAIK, other readers (except OSGx) generate
	  contiguous texture units, so I guess this option to be useful for
	  users.
	  
	  Other changes in this sumbission include the added ability to
	  tessellate polygons in Collada reader, with appropriate options.
	  - No tessellation
	  - Tessellate as triangle fan (previous behaviour, kept as default
	  for backward-compatibility)
	  - Full tessellation
	  
	  I also put auto_ptr<> for RAII of DAE structure (as discussed),
	  and moved reader options in a structure, as for the writer.
	  
	  Code also make use of osgDB::ExternalFileWriter I submitted, so
	  please merge this submission after the PluginImageWriter one.

2011-05-16 09:17  robert

	* Renamed example from osgviewerQtContext to osgviewerQt.

2011-05-16 09:15  robert

	* Added support for setting threading model from command line and

	  osgviewerQtContext --SingleThreaded
	  osgviewerQtContext --CullDrawThreadPerContext
	  osgviewerQtContext --DrawThreadPerContext
	  osgviewerQtContext --CullDrawThreadPerContext

2011-05-16 09:06  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, I have improved GraphicsWindowQt:
	  
	  - renamed osgQt::GraphWidget to osgQt::GLWidget
	  as it better fits to Qt naming (osgQt::GLWidget is derived from
	  QGLWidget
	  while recent GraphWidget... it is unclear, maybe QGraphicsView,
	  QGraphicsScene,....)
	  - added the code to properly manage ON_DEMAND rendering scheme
	  (involves osgQt::setViewer() and internal HeartBeat class)
	  - added forward key events functionality. It allows to not eat
	  the key events
	  by GLWidget, but it forwards them to Qt processing as well.
	  - destroying GLWidget before GraphicsWindowQt and vice versa does
	  not crash
	  the application
	  - it is possible to request particular QGLFormat in GLWidget
	  constructor
	  - added QtWindowingSystem class
	  - multithread OSG rendering improvements/fixes
	  
	  --
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added back in getGraphWidget() method for
	  backwards compatibility.

2011-05-16 08:59  robert

	* Fixed traling spaces

2011-05-16 08:50  robert

	* From Rafa Gata, I've been playing around with serializers in
	  order to use it as a
	  "generic" property mechanism for osg::Object.
	  
	  The main problem I have found is that InputStream and
	  OutputStream
	  only takes the stream when you call start method, and in that
	  case it
	  attaches to the stream buffer some stuff, useful for files but
	  not for
	  runtime/gui usage. I have added a simple setInputIterator and
	  setOutputIterator to the classes so now you can easily serialize
	  values without version and other stuff.
	  
	  Writing matrix:
	  osgDB::OutputStream os(0);
	  std::stringstream sstream;
	  os.setOutputIterator(new AsciiOutputIterator(&sstream));
	  os << matrix;
	  std::string value = sstream.str();
	  
	  Reading matrix:
	  osgDB::InputStream is(0);
	  std::stringstream sstream(value);
	  is.setInputIterator(new AsciiInputIterator(&sstream));
	  osg::Matrixf mat2;
	  is >> mat2;
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added doxygen comments to clarify the role
	  of the methods.

	  management of writing out external files to disk
	  avoid writing out of duplicates.

2011-05-12 13:12  robert

	* From Sukender, "Here is a tiny fix which adds missing virtual
	  methods in osgUtil::TransformAttributeFunctor, to handle Vec3d."

2011-05-12 13:08  robert

2011-05-12 12:28  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "A Chinese engineer (named Beilei Geng) reports a

	  incorrect if there are quotation marks ( " ) in the shader file,
	  which

	  Replace all " into \" before writing to cpp files will solve the
	  problem, as the attached file shows."

2011-05-12 11:45  robert

	* From Rene Molenaar, "I have found a problem regarding manifest in
	  the plugins,
	  see
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/browser/OpenSceneGraph/trunk/src/CMakeLists.txt
	  the option OSG_MSVC_GENERATE_PLUGINS_AND_WRAPPERS_MANIFESTS is
	  set to ON only after the subdirectories are added,
	  this causes /MANIFEST:NO while the option is ON after the first
	  configure, generate.
	  
	  if this option is moved (i.e. above the ADD_SUBDIRECTORY
	  statement) results are as expected.

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a small enhancement for
	  GraphicsWindowCocoa to
	  implement the recently introduced setSyncToVBlank-method.
	  
	  Additionally I added a ToggleSyncToVBlank-eventhandler to
	  osgViewer. I

	  * returns an empty array on any error.*/
	  virtual DirectoryContents getDirectoryContents(const std::string&
	  dirName) const = 0;

	  This fix addresses
	  a bug that occurred when writting to a streamstream.

2011-04-29 09:16  robert

	* Update ChangeLog

2011-04-28 16:33  robert

	* Fixed Coverity reported issue.
	  
	  CID 11447: Unchecked dynamic_cast (FORWARD_NULL)
	  Dynamic cast to pointer "dynamic_cast <struct osg::NodeCallback
	  *>(nc->clone(this))" can return null.
	  Assigning null: "first" = "dynamic_cast <struct osg::NodeCallback
	  *>(nc->clone(this))".
	  
	  The clone() implementation is written using macro's so that it
	  always returns the type of Object
	  being cloned so it's normally safe to assume that a
	  dynamic_cast<> will always return a valid pointer as long
	  as the new T that involves creates a valid object. However, if
	  the class being cloned doesn't correctly
	  implement the clone() method then their potential for the
	  dynamic_cast to fail and will return a NULL and will
	  result in a memory leak of the object of paraent class that the
	  clone would have defaulted to.
	  
	  I've tightened up the CopyOp.cpp code to check the return type
	  and added better handling of the clone in the
	  osg::clone() methods so thay don't have any potential mememory
	  leaks and report warnings to OSG_WARN when
	  problems are encountered. It may be more apporpriate to throw an
	  exception so will need to ponder this
	  issue further.

2011-04-28 10:23  robert

	* Fixed Coverity reported issue.
	  
	  CID 11403: Logically dead code (DEADCODE)
	  After this line, the value of "needspace" is equal to 0.
	  Assigning: "needspace" = "false".
	  
	  Technically the report is correct, but the code is just debugging
	  code that was there just in case
	  the code needed to be reviewed. This code is long since through
	  it's debugging stage so the code
	  is no longer really worth keeping so I've removed it for
	  cleanness sake.

2011-04-28 10:23  robert

	* Fixed Coverity reported issue.
	  
	  ID 11667: Uninitialized scalar field (UNINIT_CTOR)
	  Non-static class member _useVertexAttribAlias is not initialized
	  in this constructor nor in any functions that it calls.
	  
	  Member variable should have been initialized but this varaible
	  will have always been initialized in later code
	  before it was used anyway so wouldn't have resulted in a runtime
	  bug.

2011-04-28 10:22  robert

	* Fixed Coverity reported issue.
	  
	  CID 11414: Logically dead code (DEADCODE)
	  After this line, the value of "vboMemory" is equal to 0.
	  Assigning: "vboMemory" = "NULL".
	  
	  Another case of debugging code paths being picked out. I have
	  chosen to just delete these paths as the code
	  looks to be working fine and less code is better than more code
	  when it comes to maintenance.

2011-04-27 16:37  robert

	* Fixed Coverity reported issue. Issue is benign as all the member
	  variables are initialized in after construction,
	  but I've moved this initialization into the constructor to make
	  the code more managable.
	  
	  CID 11686: Uninitialized scalar field (UNINIT_CTOR)
	  Non-static class member cnt is not initialized in this
	  constructor nor in any functions that it calls.

2011-04-27 16:35  robert

	* Fixed 2 Coverity reported issues. Both issues are benign, but
	  I've addressed then as with the changes the
	  code is clean and more mantainable.

2011-04-27 16:01  robert

	* Fixed 2 Coverity reported issues.
	  
	  Following are both false positives as the the scope they are in
	  will always assign the object to a ref counted
	  structure. I've modified the code to use ref_ptr<> to just make
	  it clear that it's underscope, although
	  this is not strictly neccessary as the code is OK, I introduced
	  this for clarity and robustness in
	  presence of exceptions.
	  
	  CID 11586: Resource leak (RESOURCE_LEAK)

	* Fixed 1 Coverity Low Impact issue "Unused pointer value
	  (UNUSED_VALUE)
	  Pointer "indices" returned by
	  "this->_vertexAttribList[0ULL].indices.get()" is never used."
	  
	  Report highlighted the fact that later code wasn't using the
	  indices variable when it should have been, so
	  potentially a higher impact that the severity suggested by
	  Coverity.

2011-04-26 19:29  robert

	* Fixed 3 Coverity Low Impact performance issues relating to "Big
	  parameter passed by value".

2011-04-26 15:24  robert

2011-04-26 14:55  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS for 2.9.13 dev release

2011-04-26 12:07  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Fixes two of the osgWidget examples that
	  were broken due to changed
	  virtual function prototypes in osgWidget/EventInterface"

2011-04-26 12:05  robert

	* From Craig Bosma,"Please find attached a fix for shared contexts
	  on OS X, with the Cocoa backend. The NSOpenGLContext* _context
	  member of GraphicsHandleCocoa was never set on successfully
	  creation, so even if the dynamic_cast to GraphicsHandleCocoa
	  succeeds, we get a bogus (NULL) pointer on retrieving the actual
	  NSOpenGLContext* (line 1013).
	  
	  This should fix the problem, as well as cause GraphicsWindowCocoa
	  to report the correct name "GraphicsWindowCarbon" ->
	  "GraphicsWindowCocoa".
	  "

2011-04-26 11:51  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I believe their is small error in how
	  OutputStream handles the WriteImageHint. In the "writeImage"
	  method, it converts the WriteImageHint to an internal "decision"
	  flag. During this conversion, it seems to be swapping the
	  behavior for WRITE_EXTERNAL_FILE and WRITE_USE_EXTERNAL. I've
	  attached what I believe to be the correct conversion."

2011-04-21 17:16  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Fixes installation of the osgViewer
	  headers that got broken with rev
	  12208 and 12231.
	  
	  The windowing system specific headers under
	  include/osgViewer/api/<system> are again installed under
	  include/osgViewer/api/<system>
	  
	  Works in recent ubuntu with cmake-2.8.4 and msvc2010 with
	  cmake-2.8.2"

2011-04-21 17:04  robert

	* From Johannes Baeuerele, "I have extended the pvr reader plugin
	  to support etc1 compression(GL_ETC1_RGB8_OES). The changes
	  attached to this submission are based on today's trunk.
	  
	  The pvr format which can be used as a wrapper for different
	  compressed and uncompressed formats supports this compression
	  algorithm. The original pvr compression uses the pvrtc format.
	  The handling of pvrtc is already implemented in the pvr plugin.
	  PVR provides wrapper functionality for some formats, e.g. etc or
	  even dxt/dds.
	  
	  Our target system (gles2) is able to use the etc compression
	  format. With minor changes in the submitted files, there is no
	  need to write a separate plugin. However the original pvr texture
	  compression formats are not supported on our target, which is the
	  reason for this extension.
	  
	  The changes mainly consist in the definition on new enum values
	  in the classes and headers of ReaderWriterPVR,Image and Texture.
	  I also found some locations where the handling of the original
	  pvr textures was not implemented. These are also part of this
	  submission."

2011-04-21 13:34  robert

	* From Marius Heise, "here is a patch that implements Win32
	  HW-synced swapping using wglJoinSwapGroupNV, wglBindSwapBarrierNV
	  and the existing traits. It was tested with multiple ATI FirePro
	  S400 cards.
	  
	  I also fixed the vsync implementation introduced with rev.11357
	  that was crashing with the Windows Error #170. So I removed your
	  temporary /* */ around the vsync condition..."

2011-04-21 13:01  robert

	* From Fred Smith, "GraphicsWindowWin32::setWindow currently
	  creates a context with no regards to the Traits, like
	  createWindow does.
	  
	  That is, it calls ::wglCreateContext to create a context, not the
	  member method createContextImplementation(), which takes into an
	  account the Traits.
	  
	  In my situation, this prevents a GL 3.x context from being
	  created.
	  "

2011-04-21 12:53  robert

	* From Jorge Ciges, "1rst - Changes in Cmake: They make possible
	  "make install" with the android building.
	  
	  2nd - Script to use a 3rd party directory with basic libraries:
	  libjpeg,libpng,libtiff,giflib,freetype,curl,gdal.
	  
	  3rd - Change in the GLES library loading for Android. That should
	  make GLES2 work properly.
	  
	  4rth- Included two defines RGB8_OES and RGBA8_OES as a substitute
	  in GLES for RGB8 and RGBA8
	  
	  5th - OpenGL and GLSL version identification changed to recognize
	  GLES versions properly

	* From Cedric Pinson, "I have tried some model that produces
	  crashes in the dae plugin because
	  of empty node:
	  
	  if (GetFloat4Param(cot->getParam()->getRef(), f4)) {...}
	  
	  in the model I have tested cot->getParam()->getRef() return 0x0
	  and make
	  it crahes inside GetFloat4Param.
	  
	  I have added a test before calling GetFloat4Param
	  if (cot->getParam()->getRef() != 0 &&
	  GetFloat4Param(cot->getParam()->getRef(), f4)) {...}
	  "

2011-04-21 12:06  robert

	* From Tomas Hogarth, "Attached are the complete changed files
	  GraphicsWindowIOS and GraphicsWindowIOS.mm. The change is in
	  regard to the ability to adapt to device orientation. We did just
	  have a bool indicating the window would adapt to all
	  orientations. I have changed this to a bit mask allowing the user
	  to specify individual orientations or combinations.
	  
	  enum DeviceOrientation{
	  
	  PORTRAIT_ORIENTATION = 1<<0,
	  
	  PORTRAIT_UPSIDEDOWN_ORIENTATION = 1<<1,
	  
	  LANDSCAPE_LEFT_ORIENTATION = 1<<2,
	  
	  LANDSCAPE_RIGHT_ORIENTATION = 1<<3,
	  
	  ALL_ORIENTATIONS = PORTRAIT_ORIENTATION |
	  PORTRAIT_UPSIDEDOWN_ORIENTATION | LANDSCAPE_LEFT_ORIENTATION |
	  LANDSCAPE_RIGHT_ORIENTATION
	  
	  };
	  
	  typedef unsigned int DeviceOrientationFlags;
	  
	  The main motivation for this is to easily allow the user to
	  specifiy that the device is in a horizontal orientation rather
	  then having to rotate the view matrix. All flags have been tested
	  individually as well as in combinations. The default is
	  ALL_ORIENTATIONS to keep the exiting functionality for anyone who
	  hasn't specified WindowData for their context traits.
	  "

2011-04-20 19:20  robert

	* From Sukender, Here is a tiny update to FileNameUtils. It brings
	  getPathRoot() and isAbsolutePath() to the public side of the lib.

2011-04-20 17:15  robert

	* From Guillaume Taze, "This is a fix for the error popups which
	  appeared when reading a corrupted file on windows. Errors are
	  redirected to std::err instead."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, changed jpeg error report output from
	  stderr to standard OSG notification system using OSG_WARN.

2011-04-20 11:45  robert

	* Added releaseGLObjects(State*) support into
	  osg::FrameBufferObject, osg::RenderBin and osg::RenderStage
	  to ensure proper clean up of FBO's on closing a graphics context.

2011-04-19 14:19  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "A few minor fixes in the documentation
	  strings of ReaderWriterFLT.cpp"

2011-04-19 14:11  robert

	* From Bradley Anderegg, "The first change just exposes the archive
	  extension list so that
	  external applications can determine if an archive extension is
	  valid.
	  
	  The second change is a bug fix in Registry::read(const
	  ReadFunctor&)
	  where if you pass in valid options they get wiped out after the
	  archive
	  is loaded but before being passed along to the plugin."

2011-04-19 13:32  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "To summarize the fix: OpenGL eye coords are
	  negative outside Cartesian quadrant 1. As a result, the center of
	  projection is eye coord (0,0), which (when used as st tex coords)
	  looks up the lower left corner of the texture. However, in
	  projective texturing, you usually want eye coord (0,0) to look up
	  the center of the texture. Accomplishing this mapping requires
	  not just a lookat and perspective transform, but also a translate
	  and scale."

2011-04-19 12:01  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "please find attached proposed fix for ON_DEMAND
	  rendering. The biggest issue was
	  that the windows did not act on repaint request (WM_PAINT,
	  EXPOSE,...)
	  
	  Detailed explanation:
	  - I implemented requestRedraw using the push approach (not using
	  GraphicsWindow::_requestRedraw flag that I was considering) as
	  there may be
	  multiple viewers reading the flag and fighting to reset it after
	  the paint
	  request, while some viewers may not spot the request to redraw
	  - I made windows call GraphicsWindow::requestRedraw when they
	  receive
	  appropriate message (WM_PAINT, EXPOSE, RESIZE,...)
	  - There were issues on Linux that windows did not want to close
	  using x
	  button. Resolved by moving the test for DeleteWindow event from
	  swapBuffersImplementation() to GraphicsWindowX11::checkEvents().
	  The difficulty
	  was that DeleteWindow event is not coming using _eventDisplay,
	  but through
	  _display.
	  - The last difficulty was that it is necessary to call
	  ViewerBase::checkWindowStatus() to set _done to true when all
	  windows are
	  closed. This did not happened recently in ON_DEMAND run scheme. I
	  put the call
	  to checkWindowStatus() to eventTraversal.
	  "

2011-04-19 11:46  robert

	* Removed spaces from end of lines

2011-04-19 11:40  robert

2011-04-19 09:53  robert

	* Cleaned up example

2011-04-18 12:58  robert

	* Updated SO version number

2011-04-18 12:35  robert

	* Added IncrementalCompileOperation::compileAllForNextFrame(uint)
	  method and supporting
	  functionality that tell the IncrementalCompileOperation to
	  compile all pending objects during next draw traversal,
	  for specified number of frames.

2011-04-14 15:47  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find some enhancements for
	  the iphone-part of the readme."

2011-04-14 15:45  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "The standard width for the windows cmd and
	  terminals on many Unix systems is
	  80 columns. I reorganized some of the help strings to make the
	  output of
	  
	  osgconv --help --all
	  
	  fit to 80 columns. This avoids difficult to read line breaks
	  added by the
	  terminal program itself."

2011-04-14 15:22  robert

	* Cleaned up DXT1 support

2011-04-14 15:21  robert

	* Added IF (WIN32) around OSG_USE_UTF8_FILENAME

2011-04-14 10:44  robert

	* Added osgDB::Option string entries:
	  
	  supportsOption("dds_dxt1_rgb","set the pixel format of DXT1
	  encoded images to be RGB");
	  supportsOption("dds_dxt1_rgba","set the pixel format of DXT1
	  encoded images to be RGBA");
	  supportsOption("dds_dxt1_detect_rgba","For DXT1 encode images set
	  the pixel format according to presence of transparent pixels.");
	  
	  And set the default not to modify and detect the RGB or RGBA
	  pixel format for DXT images.

2011-04-14 09:16  robert

	* Added setting of the internal texture format

2011-04-13 19:28  robert

	* quitened down debug output

2011-04-13 19:26  robert

	* Introduced new code for detecting DXT1 images catogoriesed as RGB
	  that actually have a 1 bit alpha,
	  therefore re-interpreting these as RGBA.

2011-04-13 10:44  robert

	* Added handling of DXT1 in osg::Image::isImageTranslucent()

2011-04-11 19:11  robert

	* Added support for explitly requesting DXT1a and DXT1c compression

2011-04-04 10:16  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "Attached you'll find a fixed
	  GraphicsWindowCocoa-implementation which should fix the reported
	  bugs.
	  
	  the osgkeyboard-example works now, but not the numbers of the
	  keypad, as
	  they hilight only for KEY_KP_Left, KEY_KP_Right, KEY_KP_Up,
	  KEY_KP_DOWN
	  etc and not for KEY_KP_0 - KEY_KP_9."

2011-03-31 14:57  robert

	* Added OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_MUTEX Cmake options that allows you
	  to override the default detection
	  of atomic implementatition, making it possible to force the use
	  of Mutex for OpenThreads::Atomic,
	  and as a consequence for use of Mutex for Referenced::ref/unref()
	  counting.

2011-03-30 15:15  robert

	* From Tim Moore,
	  Fixes to race in DatabasePager where a parent PagedLOD
	  of newly loaded subgraph has been expired.
	  
	  Clean up of visitor naming to make it clearer what role it has.

2011-03-23 14:01  robert

	* Added m4v as a handled movie file extension

2011-03-21 21:28  robert

	* Added dciimage library to DCMTK libs

2011-03-21 21:28  robert

	* Improved handling of RGB data.

2011-03-19 16:25  robert

	* Added .get() to fix build

2011-03-18 12:21  robert

	* Adde an isFileADicom(..) method to enable the loader to
	  automatically identifier dicom files without making any
	  assumptions about the file extension

2011-03-18 11:23  robert

	* Added extra DCMTK libraries to search and link line to enable
	  build against new DCMTK-3.6.0 release

2011-03-17 17:33  robert

	* Added support for new SampleDensityWhenMovingProperty into .p3d
	  format, with it default to 0.02.
	  
	  One can override this value via the
	  sampleDensityWhenMoving="value" property in the volume tag, i.e.
	  
	  <volume sampleDensityWhenMoving="0.01">CardiacCT</volume>
	  
	  To switch the feature off set the value to 0, i.e.
	  
	  <volume sampleDensityWhenMoving="0">CardiacCT</volume>

2011-03-17 15:37  robert

	* Added SampleDensityWhenMovingProperty to control LOD property of
	  osgVolume.

2011-03-17 13:56  robert

	* Changed the view movement detection code so that it uses the
	  new CullVisitor::Identifier to indentifier cull traversals,
	  this enables the code to properly detect movement when
	  osgViewer::Renderer uses double buffering of SceneView.

2011-03-17 13:54  robert

	* Added set up of CulLVisitor::Identifier so that the double
	  buffered SceneView/CullVisitor
	  share the same Identifier.

2011-03-17 13:54  robert

	* Added CullVisitor::Identifier to help with cull operations that
	  require a consistent identifier for
	  cull traveresals when osgViewer::Renderer uses double buffering.

2011-03-17 11:49  robert

	* First cut at LOD support in RayTracedTechnique, which lowers the
	  number of samples taken when the view of the volume is changing.

2011-03-16 13:48  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, "adds an additional library name of libpng
	  ( libpng15 ) to search fo"

2011-03-16 13:41  robert

	* From Alan Dickinson,"I tested out my changes against the trunk
	  and everything worked fine... except I noticed that the
	  CMAKE_BUILD_POSTFIX is set incorrectly for a undefined or blank
	  BUILD_TYPE.
	  
	  So here is the one line change to the CMakeLists.txt to rectify
	  this omission."

2011-03-16 10:51  robert

	* Added hud and billboard support to image, stereo_image, pdf,
	  browser and vnc image placement

2011-03-15 19:54  robert

	* Added support hud property for title, bullets and paragraph tags

2011-03-15 14:04  robert

	* From Sukender, "Fixed a case where getUniqueName() does not work
	  properly"

2011-03-15 14:02  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, update to reflect addition of NVTT to
	  Windows 3rdPartyPackage

2011-03-15 13:53  robert

	* Added checked against GL version number for enabled
	  _isTexture3DSupported.

2011-03-15 13:40  robert

	* Fixed warning

2011-03-15 13:30  robert

	* Added OSG_EXPORT to declaration of View::Slave.

2011-03-15 12:48  robert

	* Re-enabled the fallback compute of bounding volume.

2011-03-15 12:26  robert

	* Fixed updating of text position when PositionData.position is not
	  modified by tag but other elements of PositionData are - such as
	  when billboarding

2011-03-14 21:36  robert

	* Implemented billboard="on" option for image, bullet and paragraph
	  tags

2011-03-14 11:29  robert

	* Added support for placing comments at end of each line.

2011-03-14 10:07  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Another update. I added a LIMIT_NEAREST
	  enum which implements your previous suggestion of rejecting
	  bounding volumes further from the nearest existing intersection.
	  I only implemented this for LineSegmentIntersector. I'd
	  appreciate it if you could double check the math I added to
	  LineSegmentIntersector::intersects() for checking if the bounding
	  sphere is further away. The results of this are promising. I'm
	  getting noticeable performance increase for line intersections
	  with scenes containing many drawables.
	  "

2011-03-14 09:59  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, warning fix for a false positive warning
	  generated by VS about "not all control pathes return a value".

2011-03-11 17:20  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, removal of redundent spaces at the end of
	  lines.

2011-03-11 16:31  robert

	* From Benjamin Wasty and David Guthrie, "currently,
	  non-alpha-numeric keys are not recognized (except as modifiers)
	  in osgQt, so I added the mapping code from my Qt integration to
	  GraphicsWindowQt (which is based on Delta3D code from David
	  Guthrie - he gave me permission to submit it under OSGPL)."

2011-03-11 11:25  robert

	* From Sukender, "Added support for texcoords scale and offset (UV
	  scaling and offset in Lib3DS Materials), for texture unit 0."

2011-03-11 11:20  robert

	* Fixed the case insenstive search under unices

2011-03-11 10:24  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine,
	  "There is a redundant cmake code at the end of osgViewer cmake
	  script. The install command is issued in SETUP_LIBRARY macro."
	  "I spotted this when i tried a make install on the android port
	  :) I saw some weird copy commands of osgViewer headers.
	  I managed to get all osg headers copied to
	  cmake_install_prefix/include upon make install, but i can't (yet)
	  get the libraries to be copied to cmake_install_prefix/lib (see
	  attached files)"

2011-03-11 10:18  robert

	* From Alan Dickinson, "I modified the CPack and CMake files to
	  utilze the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when building RPM packages.
	  
	  I also modified the CMake and pkgconfig files to append the
	  _POSTFIX extenstion based on the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
	  
	  Additionally I fixed
	  packaging/ld.so.conf.d/openscenegraph.conf.in to add a '/'
	  betweeen the arguments since the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can't end
	  with a '/'.
	  "

2011-03-10 14:53  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "I gave osg android port a try on
	  Windows using cygwin, and it worked like a charm (only a tiny
	  problem with osgViewer, when cross compiling for android using
	  cygwin, the windows path in osgViewer/CMakeLists.txt is used
	  rather than the android one, fix attached).
	  "

2011-03-10 14:44  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "I gave projects folders in VS a try, it
	  works for applications, plugins and examples but not for the osg
	  core libraries.
	  Attached OsgMacroUtils.cmake is a tiny fix for this. OpenThreads
	  is addressed seperately."

2011-03-10 10:56  robert

	* From Rafa Gaitan, "Attached the fix to remove the symlinks
	  created with make install."

2011-03-10 10:52  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "I'm guessing that the stack corruption
	  was caused by calling GetFullPathNameW with the nBufferLength
	  argument as the number of bytes in the buffer, rather than the
	  number of characters. I've attached code that uses
	  GetFullPathNameW et al. with _countof() rather than sizeof() and
	  this works fine."

2011-03-09 17:35  robert

	* Quitened down timing stats

2011-03-09 16:30  robert

	* From Johannes Baeuerle, fix for memory leak

2011-03-09 15:55  robert

	* From Jan Peciva,
	  "please, find attached updates to Inventor plugin:
	  
	  - improved transparency
	  - do not treat 32-bit textures as transparent textures unless
	  they really
	  contain transparent pixels
	  - error messages forwarded to osg::notify"

2011-03-09 14:44  robert

	* From Sukender, "1. Made code a bit more readable/cleaner.
	  2. Removed unecessary code. Also made sure the images names are
	  not truncated in the middle of an UTF8 character. You'll find
	  there a function called utf8TruncateBytes(), which may be moved
	  in core OSG (osgDB/ConvertUTF I guess). Feel free to do it if you
	  feel it that way.
	  "

2011-03-09 14:15  robert

	* From Piotr Gwiazdowski, "So there's config setting
	  OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS which should
	  disable pragmas that turn off specific warnings for MSVC.
	  Unfortunately it's presence is only checked in osg/Export header,
	  making other Export headers disable warnings no matter what,
	  which is
	  kind of incoherent.
	  
	  My fix adds #include <osg/Config> to every Export header. I've
	  also
	  unified checking whether to disable warnings to current
	  osg/Export
	  way:
	  #if defined(_MSC_VER) && defined(OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS).
	  
	  Attachment contains all changed Export files in their original
	  locations."

2011-03-09 13:10  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I have updated the pnm plugin to use
	  streams instead of C-style I/O. Attached is
	  src/osgPlugins/pnm/ReaderWriterPNM.cpp"

2011-03-09 13:05  robert

	* From Tassilo Glander,"I patched the cmake configuration to
	  support folders, which are really handy to organize the many
	  projects in the OSG solution into examples, applications and core
	  libs in the IDE.
	  This feature has been introduced to cmake in 2.8.3, on older
	  versions it should be ignored silently. I tested on Visual Studio
	  2008 with cmake 2.8.3 and 2.8.4.
	  
	  See the screenshots for comparison [img]osg_solution.png[/img]
	  
	  This needs few changes:
	  
	  activate on global cmakelist.txt:
	  
	  [code]set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY USE_FOLDERS On)[/code]
	  
	  set appropriate folder names for project type in
	  osgMacroUtils.cmake:
	  
	  [code]SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${CORELIB_NAME} PROPERTIES FOLDER
	  "OSG Core")[/code]
	  
	  similar for examples, applications"

2011-03-09 12:29  robert

	* From Piotr Gwiazdowski, "Recently I've been having some trouble
	  with osgWidget::StyleManager
	  (I'll omit osgWidget namespace from now on). It seems to me that
	  there
	  are some inconsistency in the code. In Style there are multiple
	  applyStyle method overloads, applying style for different
	  widgets/windows built-in in osgWidget. Plus you can do overrides.
	  It's
	  good so far.
	  
	  The problem lies in StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject (which
	  calls
	  _coearceAndApply, which calls _applySpecificStyle, which calls
	  Style::applyStyle). With current implementation Style::applyStyle
	  variants for Input, Window, Frame::Corner, Frame::Border,
	  Window::EmbeddedWindow are never called, because their classes'
	  names
	  are omitted in methods' if/else if block, making it impossible to
	  use
	  styles with most than half of built-in widget/window types.
	  
	  My fix simply adds couple else if blocks, making each
	  Style::applyStyle variant callable. By the way, I think that next
	  update should add Style::applyStyle overload for Table class and
	  add
	  proper className overloads for Input and Window."

2011-03-09 12:15  robert

	* Removed the repeated called to jas_init() and
	  jas_image_clearfmts() calls to make it possible to use the
	  reading multi-threaded

2011-03-09 11:22  robert

	* From Dietmar Funck, "I've noticed an issue with
	  osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp() if the number of buffer
	  attachments of the camera decreases according to privous calls.
	  This happens because RenderStage::_bufferAttachmentMap is updated
	  only for the number of buffers the camera has when runCameraSetUp
	  is called.
	  For example if there were 4 attachments and now only 3, only the
	  first three elements of _bufferAttachmentMap are changed. The
	  fourth is just as before - however it shouldn't be there.
	  
	  Calling _bufferAttachmentMap.clear() before resolves this
	  problem.
	  "

2011-03-09 11:15  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "I have just adjusted the FindCOLLADA
	  function to let it find library on
	  gnu/linux."

2011-03-09 11:13  robert

	* From Sukender, "I fixed the writing but never thought about the
	  reading part...
	  Here is the fix for reading path containing %23 (= '#')
	  characters."

2011-03-09 11:06  robert

	* Updated versions for next OSG dev release

2011-03-09 10:35  robert

	* Changed the use of a viewer thread to be off by default because
	  it was causing the application to crash when any users input was
	  recieved

2011-03-08 17:05  robert

	* Fixed error in X11 string name

2011-03-08 16:35  robert

	* From Rafa Gaitan and Jorge Izquierdo, build support for Android
	  NDK.
	  
	  "- In order to build against GLES1 we execute:
	  $ mkdir build_android_gles1

	  - GLES2 is not tested/proved, but I think it could be possible
	  build
	  it with the correct cmake flags.
	  - The flag -DJ=2 is used to pass to the ndk-build the number of
	  processors to speed up the building.
	  - make install is not yet supported."

2011-03-08 15:31  robert

	* Fixed indentation

2011-03-08 13:51  robert

	* From Rafa Gaitan, "I have added the macro SETUP_LIBRARY, similar
	  to SETUP_PLUGIN or
	  SETUP_EXE, in order to have a unique entry point to build the
	  libraries. With this changes the android integration will be less
	  painful (currently is a big IF(ANDROID) for each CMakeLists.txt)
	  and
	  more maintainable in the future. I hope next submissions will be
	  for
	  supporting android from my colleague Jorge.
	  "

2011-03-07 14:42  robert

	* Added comments

2011-03-07 13:45  robert

	* Changed all .c++ to .cpp's

2011-03-07 12:35  robert

	* Added --color r g b a, --wall-color r g b a, --back-color r g b a
	  options for setting the colours of faces via materials.
	  and --image filename, --wall-image filename, --back-image
	  filename options to set the textures used, note, texcoords are
	  not currently set up so texels used will be 0,0.

2011-03-07 12:33  robert

	* Enabled the settng/getting of the Text3D's WallStateSet and
	  BackStateSet along with use of these in the rendering
	  implementation
	  to allow separate colour and other state to be assigned to the
	  front, wall and back faces.

2011-03-03 15:52  robert

	* Moved intial cut of depth partition support into osgViewer::View
	  via two new methods:
	  
	  /** Convenience method for setting up multiple slave cameras that
	  depth partition the specified camera.*/
	  bool setUpDepthPartitionForCamera(osg::Camera* cameraToPartition,
	  DepthPartitionSettings* dps=0);
	  
	  /** Convenience method for setting up multiple slave cameras that
	  depth partition each of the view's active cameras.*/
	  bool setUpDepthPartition(DepthPartitionSettings* dsp=0);

2011-03-03 12:33  robert

	  it's full on at the bottom of the screen, and full transparent at
	  the bottom.

2011-02-23 13:56  robert

	* Added support for negative --xMultipler, --yMultiple and

	  different datasets and camera settings.

2011-02-22 11:59  robert

	* Added support for GL_BGR and GL_BGRA pixel formats

2011-02-22 10:53  robert

	  erroneous files are encountered.

2011-02-21 12:29  robert

	* Added computePositions() call to
	  Text3D::resizeGLObjectsBuffers(uint)

2011-02-21 10:02  robert

	* Added --fov and --light-pos and --light-dir command line
	  parameters

2011-02-18 11:04  mplatings

	* Disabled the RGB components of the opacity texture

2011-02-14 16:24  robert

	* From Philipp Svehla, "We’ve added support for users to override
	  the default values for child elements in asset tags (for the
	  collada writer). This support was added for the following child
	  elements:
	  
	  - contributor

	  that support asset tags use the values appropriately within their
	  imported models."

2011-02-14 16:09  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "This patch fixes some performance problems with
	  the DXF loader. It removes some unnecessary copies of vertex
	  coordinates (which were causing an exponential explosion). It
	  also replaces BIND_PER_PRIMITIVE normals with BIND_PER_VERTEX so
	  that the resulting geometry will be on the fast path."

2011-02-14 16:05  robert

	* Added copyop parameter to cloneOptions() method

2011-02-14 15:59  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "The non-virtual cloneOptions() method, which is
	  now used by DatabasePager, breaks derived classes of
	  osgDB::Options. This patch uses the clone() method to clone
	  Options."

2011-02-14 15:43  robert

	* From Sukender, "Here is an minor update for Jasper finder. It
	  adds debug cache value for Windows/MSVC builds, and adds search

2011-02-14 15:04  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "Improvements:
	  - Use OSG routines to load images instead of simage library
	  (removes
	  dependency on 3rdParty simage library). Applies to Coin Inventor
	  clone only.
	  "

2011-02-14 15:01  robert

	* Moved ProgramBinary into osg::Program scope

2011-02-14 14:16  robert

	* From Sukender, "Here are two sumbissions for DAE.
	  
	  1. daeRGeometry.cpp (rev 12132). A tiny sumbission which fixes a
	  quite important bug: a parameter was forgotten in Collada
	  ReaderWriter, and texture coordinates could not be loaded
	  properly. So:
	  "
	  Added missing paramter when calling createGeometryData(). Fixes
	  missing texture coordinates (in "bind_vertex_input").
	  "
	  
	  2. ReaderWriterDAE.cpp (rev 12132):
	  "
	  Added "baseImageDir" as a plugin string data, in order to
	  manually specify base directory to use when relativising image
	  file names. This is used to properly write files, when images are
	  not located in a subdirectory (like "../images" for some
	  software).
	  "

2011-02-14 13:54  robert

	* From Johannes Bauerle, "I experienced problems using binary
	  shaders in osgt files (=the osg-serializer plugins). At runtime
	  std::bad_alloc errors were thrown when using binary shaders.
	  
	  The reason is that the .osgt text files do not provide size
	  information about the contained binary shader hence leading to a
	  bad allocation when reading the shader data, probably size 0 ?
	  The reader method in the responsible serializer class
	  (serializers/osg/BinaryShader) is correct and does not need to be
	  changed as it queries the size as expected. The writer method
	  supports two paths(binary output .osgb and text output
	  .osgt/.osgx). Only the text path is affected as the binary path
	  writes the size.
	  
	  I extended the writer in the text path by the size information.
	  The results before and after the fix are shown below:
	  
	  Erroneous code for binary shader in osgt file before fix:
	  
	  Data {
	  0a
	  0d
	  0
	  ...
	  }
	  
	  Corrected code for binary shader in osgt file after fix:
	  
	  Data 524 {
	  0a
	  0d
	  0
	  ...
	  }
	  
	  After my fix the the thrown error disappeared."

2011-02-14 13:50  robert

	* From Jahannes Bauerle, "l discovered that the shader
	  class(/src/osg/Shader.cpp) shows wrong behavior when using binary
	  shaders . When shader objects are compared the reference pointer
	  behind the _shaderBinary member is not included in the
	  comparison.
	  
	  I included binary shaders into an osgt model file. These shaders
	  only consists of the binary shader code, I did not supply the
	  text version additionally. When loading the model the
	  osg::Optimizer threw away all shaders except the first one. In
	  the current trunk version of the file two shader objects are
	  identical despite differing _shaderBinary members as the compare
	  method of the Shader class does not include the comparison of
	  that member.
	  
	  The fix in this submission adds the check for identity of the
	  referenced binary shaders to the shader class.
	  
	  When comparing two shader objects with text source shaders the
	  new lines of comparison are not even executed as the comparison
	  returns false in the previous lines when the text shaders differ.
	  
	  With this fix I get expected behavior, the Optimizer handles the
	  different shaders correctly."

2011-02-14 12:55  robert

	* Set debug message to INFO

2011-02-14 12:54  robert

	* From Michael Platings, I've added initial support to osg for
	  glGetProgramBinary and glProgramBinary. This means that shader
	  programs can now be cached to disk and later reloaded, which is
	  much faster than linking shaders from source code. This should
	  mean significantly shorter load times for people who use lots of
	  combinations of shaders.

2011-02-14 12:14  robert

2011-01-28 10:59  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Driven by the last qfontimplementation
	  changes, I realized, that I never
	  contributed my testcase/demo for the original implementation.
	  This attached change is similar to osgtext but uses the
	  QFontImplementation in

2011-01-27 17:12  robert

	* From Sukender, "I found the bug I was chasing! Here is my "twin"
	  submission, from latest trunk rev: 12124.
	  
	  1. DAE submission:
	  DAE plugin now correctly writes images URI in Collada file, when
	  images are used twice.
	  I also greatly improved readability and maintenability of
	  geometry reading (mainly daeRGeometry.cpp), by factorizing code,
	  templatizing it (for double/single precision), and removing ugly
	  macros.
	  
	  2. osgDB submission:
	  I updated osgDB::getPathRelative(): it is now far more readable,
	  it handles more cases (especially when you want to relativise
	  "a/c" from "a/b", which results in "../c"), and I added comments
	  to make it clearer to maintain."

2011-01-27 16:23  robert

	* From Alexander Sinditskiy, "reason of this changes described in

	  and another problem is:
	  example osgkeyboard is not work (keys not highlight) if user have
	  2 keyboard layout native and english and current user layout is
	  native
	  
	  I try to explain my changes
	  
	  we need something that is identify key without modifier keys and
	  layout -> this is UnmodifedKey
	  
	  I think osg must have its own UnmodifiedKeys table. Code must be
	  run same on different platforms. This can de guaranteed by
	  UnmodifiedKeys table.

	* Added #include to fix build

2011-01-21 13:40  robert

	* From Sukender, "
	  DAE plugin was linking ORIGINAL images in the Collada file, using
	  image->getName() as a path (even if images were modified in
	  memory!). As the behaviour was not the one of other plugins (3DS,
	  FBX, and such), I made the plugin relativise images filenames (as
	  those plugins) and write the image which is in memory. However,
	  in order to avoid removing features, I kept the previous
	  behaviour but moved it in an option. Here are the options of the
	  plugin I changed:
	  - daeForceTexture was unclear in this new context and removed in
	  favor of two new options
	  - daeLinkOriginalTexturesNoForce: Writes reference to the
	  original image if found, instead of writing the image in memory
	  - daeLinkOriginalTexturesForce: Writes reference to the original
	  image even if not found, instead of writing the image in memory
	  Of course, if you specify no option, images are written as for
	  other plugins.
	  
	  Other thing I changed is the UTF8 support as I told you in a
	  previous conversation. Now there is a simple option,
	  "daeNamesUseCodepage", which makes all names except filenames
	  (materials, animation, geometries...) be considered as encoded
	  using current codepage. If so, they'll be converted to UTF8 when
	  writing; else they are written directly. Of course, filenames
	  follow OSG_USE_UTF8_FILENAME as usual.
	  
	  I did "

2011-01-21 12:17  mplatings

	* From Sukender: I had to call code from the FBX plugin (to

	* From Simon Julier, "I have been using the ply plugin to read
	  files created by bundler and pmvs2
	  (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/pmvs/). This program
	  generates models in the form of vertices only. However, the
	  existing ply reader implementation was not able to handle the
	  models generated in a satisfactory manner for two reasons:
	  
	  1. It did not support normals applied to individual vertices.
	  2. It would only support red / green / blue colour triples, but
	  the pmvs models are generated with diffuse colours. (The PLY

	  The changes I've made are:
	  
	  1. I have changed the boolean hasColor flag to a vertexField
	  (which is a boolean operation on an enum) to indicate what fields
	  are present in the ply file. (This is required because Turk's ply
	  reader spits out warnings for every line where you try to read
	  fields which do not exist.)
	  2. I have modified the code to apply valid normals to either
	  triangles or vertices.
	  3. I have kludged in "support" for the various colour variants.
	  Specifically, all the colour specified can be read from the file.
	  However, they are all applied in the same way (namely as a colour
	  array, bound to each vertex)."

	* From Simon Julier, "I ran across linking errors with osgdb_exr.
	  Specifically, I found it was necessary to link against libImlIlf,
	  libImlThread, libHalf, libIex and libzip.
	  
	  I have attached a patch, against the trunk from 13:30 today,
	  which consists of the following:
	  
	  1. CMakeModules/FindOpenEXR.cmake: Look for libIlmThread and
	  libIex as well. 2. src/osgPlugins/CMakeList.txt: Only include the
	  exr subdirectory if both the OpenEXR and zip libraries were
	  found. 3. src/osgPlugins/exr/CMakeLists.txt: Add ZIP_LIBRARY to
	  TARGET_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES."

2011-01-19 10:38  robert

	* From Sukender, normalized option names

2011-01-19 10:31  robert

	* From Sukender, "Added ability for writer to read from Vec3/4d/f.
	  Plugin now warns if it finds another type of data"

2011-01-19 09:53  robert

	* From Sukender, "Factorized the depth loop ("while ( lastDepth >=
	  _nodePath.size() )...") into a method called
	  updateCurrentDaeNode(). Added missing calls into
	  apply(osg::LightSource &) and daeWriter::apply(osg::Camera &) and
	  daeWriter::apply(osg::CameraView &)"

2011-01-19 09:36  robert

	* From Sukender, "Fixed
	  ReaderWriterDAE::ConvertFilePathToColladaCompatibleURI(): It now
	  handles paths containing '#' character as expected."

2011-01-19 09:34  robert

	* From Sukender and Robert Osfield, clean up of options

2011-01-18 16:14  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "I've attached a fix for a subtle bug that
	  causes animations (and quite possibly other things) to be
	  serialized incorrectly.
	  
	  For the following code:
	  
	  #define MYMACRO(NAME) myOutputStream << #NAME;
	  MYMACRO(Group)
	  
	  you would expect that "Group" would be output. However, as there
	  are many overloaded operator<< functions, none of which take a
	  const char* argument, the function that's actually called is
	  operator<<(bool). Hence what actually gets output is "TRUE".
	  An actual example of this is in
	  serializers\osgAnimation\Animation.cpp, WRITE_CHANNEL_FUNC2.
	  
	  So the simple solution to this is to add operator<<(const char*),
	  attached.
	  "

2011-01-18 15:00  robert

	* Moved the StateSet query and texcoord settings to within the if
	  (vertices) block to avoid
	  an attempt to dereferences geometry->getStateSet() when non
	  Geometry drawable is intersected.

2011-01-18 11:20  robert

	* Fixed CompileSet so it returns true when there is nothing to
	  compile at all.

2011-01-18 09:54  robert

	* Build fix

2011-01-17 17:17  robert

	* Implemented better coupling of DatabasePager and
	  IcrementalCompileOperation,
	  removing functional duplication and opening the door to dynamic
	  enabling/disabling
	  of pre compile based on load.

2011-01-17 09:10  robert

	* Added getNum methods

2011-01-15 18:12  robert

	* First steps on the path to integrating ImageProcessor

2011-01-14 14:30  robert

	* From Guy Volckaert, "Changes to the openflight plugin to support
	  replacing double sided polygons by 2 opposite facing polygons.
	  This is sometimes required to resolved lighting and intersection
	  issues. A new import option was was added to activate this
	  feature called "replaceDoubleSidedPolys".
	  

2011-01-14 13:31  robert

	* From Sukender, "- Lowered one notify level (it's now coherent
	  with the "if" just above)"

2011-01-14 12:08  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit a small new feature to the
	  osgmanipulator example
	  which could fix the dragger size in screen, so that no matter how
	  we
	  zoom in/out the camera, the dragger will never be scaled.
	  
	  This is what 3D graphics software like 3dsmax and maya behave,
	  which
	  helps users select and manipulate draggers more easily.
	  
	  You may turn on the feature with the new --fixedDraggerSize
	  argument:
	  
	  # osgmanipulator.exe --fixedDraggerSize --dragger
	  TranslateAxisDragger
	  cessna.osg
	  "

2011-01-14 12:03  robert

	* From Sukender, "TIFF plugin now outputs messages coming from
	  libtiff.
	  "

2011-01-14 11:49  robert

	* From Sukender, "Small submission: - 3DS reader now takes care to
	  not create Texture2D duplicates"

2011-01-14 11:46  robert

	* Fixed for build with non autoatic ref_ptr<> to C pointer
	  conversion

2011-01-14 11:00  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "Attached is a fix which implements the
	  lazy loading of optional layers (if requested) in the new
	  osgb/osgt formats."

2011-01-13 18:49  robert

	* Updated so version number

2011-01-13 18:05  robert

	* From Tim Moore, added missing ImageProcessor header reference

2011-01-13 14:59  robert

	* Added ImageProcessor interface class and plugin mechnanism for
	  ImageProcessor implementations to osgDB::Registry.
	  
	  Add NVidiaTextureTools based plugin that provides an
	  ImageProcessor implementation within an nvtt plugin.

2011-01-12 19:29  robert

	* Refactored the way that the DatabasePager passes the Terrain
	  decorator node onto the TerrainTile.
	  
	  The DatabasePager now passes the Terrain pointer into the
	  ReaderWriter's via osgDB::Options object,
	  rather than pushing a NodePath containing the Terrain onto
	  NodeVisitor. This
	  change means that the DatabasePager nolonger needs to observer
	  the whole NodePath and
	  will be lighter and quicker for it.
	  
	  The change also means that ReadFileCallback can now run custom
	  NodeVisitor's on the scene graph without
	  having to worry about TerrainTile's constructing scene graphs
	  prior to the Terrain being assigned.
	  
	  Also changed is the NodeVisitor::DatabaseRequestHandler which now
	  requires a NodePath to the node that you wish
	  to add to rather than just the pointer to the node you wish to
	  add to. This is more robust when handling scenes
	  with multiple parental paths, whereas previously errors could
	  have occurred due to the default of picking the first
	  available parental path. This change means that subclasses of
	  DatabasePager will need to be updated to use this new
	  function entry point.

2011-01-12 17:39  robert

	* Fixed comment

2011-01-11 17:29  robert

	* From Sukender, "FBX plugin did not relay the
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options* when writing images (the
	  writeImage() call). Now it does."

2011-01-11 17:29  robert

	* Changed dos endings to unix line endings

2011-01-11 17:23  robert

	* From Mikhail Izmestev, "Current
	  osgManipulator::AntiSquishCallback stops update traversal of
	  childrens."

2011-01-11 17:20  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "We encountered a problem when we
	  tried overloading StandardManipulator class. Linker was unable to
	  find StandardManipulator::AnimationData methods. Prefixing
	  AnimationData with OSGGA_EXPORT removed the issue.
	  
	  Fixed header is attached."

2011-01-11 17:18  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "As an extension to this excellent work:
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=7285
	  
	  This file adds the same string API wrapper to the State object
	  for other older apps that
	  track Uniforms by string. The original comment about performance
	  is preserved."

2011-01-11 17:05  robert

	* Changed debug messages to INFO

2011-01-11 17:04  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "Attached is a fix to
	  State::convertVertexShaderSourceToOsgBuiltIns. The method was
	  incorrectly inserting new declarations before a GLSL "#version"
	  directive, which must always be the first line in a shader. This
	  patch detects the #version directive and ensures that new
	  declarations are inserted after it.
	  
	  Attached is the modified State.cpp file.
	  
	  I have also attached a sample transcript, showing the new code
	  working properly. I ran it against osgEarth's shaders and it
	  works as expected.
	  
	  "

2011-01-11 16:58  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "This patch fixes a race condition in
	  Renderer::ThreadSafeQueue that was causing some notifications of
	  available SceneView objects to be missed. I saw a very noticeable
	  performance problem (60 fps -> 8 fps) in DrawThreadPerContext
	  mode in an osgEarth application before this patch. I had high
	  hopes that this change might fix the much-discussed multiple GPU
	  problem; no such luck, but I think the root cause of that is
	  probably a similar threading issue."

2011-01-11 16:18  robert

	* From Guy Volckaert, warning fixes

2011-01-11 11:39  robert

	* Added more flexible testing of Text3D

2011-01-11 11:39  robert

	* Unified more of the 2D and 3D text setup, fixed bugs in Text3D
	  setup
	  which address the problems of black 3D text and the kerning
	  causing problems with font positioning.

2011-01-10 13:28  robert

	* Improved the handling of application argument output when the
	  options are very long.

2011-01-05 11:43  robert

	* Added check for invalid face size to prevent a crash

2011-01-04 10:21  robert

	* Added extra checks to osg::Geometry::verifyArrays(std::ostream&)

2011-01-03 19:41  robert

	* Added osg::Geometry::verifyArray(std::ostream&) method to enable
	  checks to be done on osg::Geometry to see if the arrays
	  are big enough to handle the primitives used in the geometry.
	  
	  Added usage of verifyArray into osgfilecache so that it reports
	  any problems on reading files in paged database.

2010-12-24 19:47  robert

	* Added iterator include

2010-12-24 19:19  robert

	* Refactored IncrementalCompileOperation to make it more flexible.

2010-12-23 13:11  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-12-23 10:45  robert

	* Deleted old makefile files that are no longer required now we
	  have CMake

2010-12-23 10:07  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "The FindCOLLADA.cmake module failed to find
	  the static libs for the latest collada dom, attached is the fixed
	  file."

2010-12-23 10:05  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein (applied by Robert Osfield),
	  "OpenThreads/win32/Win32Condition.h is not used anymore and could
	  be removed from the
	  repository and win32/OpenThreads.mak and win32/CMakeLists.txt."

2010-12-23 09:59  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien, "In my auto-build today there are 3 errors
	  caused by using a ref_ptr<T> in a function taking a T* when
	  building without the implicit conversion."

2010-12-22 20:11  robert

	* Converted FrameStamp::g/setFrameNumber from int to uint

2010-12-21 12:54  robert

	* From Tim Moore, Dereference the databaseRequest while the queue
	  is locked. This prevents the request from being
	  deleted at an unpredictable time within
	  addLoadedDataToSceneGraph.

2010-12-21 12:51  robert

	* Introduced a local reference to the appropriate EasyCurl object
	  to avoid seperate getEasyCurl() incurring a mutex lock overhead.

2010-12-21 10:23  robert

	* Improved indentation to make it more readable and consistent with
	  OSG.

2010-12-21 09:36  robert

	* Cleaned up the frame number increment.

2010-12-21 09:12  robert

	* From Paul Martz, Fix for "in expGeometryRecords.cpp lines
	  813-820, we write the UV list data incorrectly. According to the
	  FLT spec, the data should be grouped per-vertex, not per-layer.
	  
	  We should have:
	  UV for vertex 0, layer 1
	  UV for vertex 0, layer 2
	  UV for vertex 1, layer 1
	  UV for vertex 1, layer 2
	  ...etc...
	  
	  Instead, we have this:
	  UV for vertex 0, layer 1
	  UV for vertex 1, layer 1
	  ...etc...
	  UV for vertex 0, layer 2
	  UV for vertex 1, layer 2
	  ...etc..."

2010-12-20 17:04  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, "In this file I’ve changed TriangleFunctor to
	  TemplatePrimitiveFunctor, and added operator() methods for:
	  
	  · points (just look at points in frustum)
	  
	  · lines (simple line clip—replace the external point)
	  
	  · quadrilaterals (call operator() for triangles twice)"

2010-12-20 16:23  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, "We use a shared array for our OpenSceneGraph
	  arrays, and the existing (deprecated) OSG plugin casts the Array
	  to IntArray and FloatArray and the like. Because our arrays don’t
	  use FloatArray, this crashes for us.
	  
	  
	  
	  Attached is src/osgWrappers/deprecated-dotosg/osg/Geometry.cpp.
	  It gets the data pointer out and casts it to a pointer to the
	  element type, rather than casting the array object itself. This
	  seems to work."

2010-12-20 12:17  robert

	* Moved the GL3 include to within the code block that handles
	  GL1/GL2

2010-12-20 12:03  robert

	* Fixed memory leak by introducing use of ref_ptr<>

2010-12-20 12:02  robert

	* From Kim Seokhwan, "Error fix in
	  example/osganimationmorph/osganimationmorph.cpp
	  
	  in this file,
	  function,
	  osg::Geometry* getShape(const std::string& name)
	  (line 51)
	  
	  tries to use null pointer when model is not provided.
	  I added simple comment in attached file."

2010-12-20 10:49  robert

	* From Trajce Nikolov, Fixes to avoid cracks in older archives,
	  tested with archives 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 .

2010-12-19 13:25  robert

	* From Trajce Nicklov, "I went thru the TileMapper today very
	  carefuly and I remove all the tileStack approach - it made
	  everything simplier and I think more proper. Cleaned the code as
	  well. It was tested on huge archive with many lods as well with
	  variable lods. Fix attached."

2010-12-17 13:43  robert

	* From Tim Moore, fix for race conditions in takeOrGenerate()
	  methods

2010-12-17 11:46  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-12-17 11:19  robert

	* Added --speed <ratio> command line parameter to osgviewer to
	  enable control of the speed that animation paths are played back
	  at.

2010-12-17 10:59  robert

	* Fixed the GLBufferObjectSet::deleteAllGLBufferObjets() and
	  TextureObjectSet::deletaAllTextureObjects() methods
	  and improved the checkConsistency() usage so it's now possible to
	  switch if off completed from being compiled in.

2010-12-15 19:44  robert

	* Fixed the size computation

2010-12-15 16:30  robert

	* Removed no longer used static member variables

2010-12-15 12:34  robert

	* Improvements to GLBufferObject and TextureObject pools

2010-12-14 20:22  robert

	* Added report of ration of current size to max target size for
	  buffer.

2010-12-14 20:07  robert

	* Added --speed option and output of buffer object and texture
	  object pool stats at the end of the animation path.

2010-12-14 20:07  robert

	* Added AnimationCompletedCallback, s/getTimeScale and
	  s/getTimeOffset() method to enable finer control of
	  AnimationPathManipulator.

2010-12-14 19:29  robert

	* Added methods for checking sizes of various buffer object/texture
	  object pool sizes.

	* Added GLBufferObjectManager::reportStats()

2010-12-14 10:42  robert

	* From Alan Dickenson, "I modified the CPack CMake files to provide
	  the ability to easily create packages of the OpenSceneGraph
	  components.
	  
	  I modified the OsgCPackConfig.cmake.in and OsgCPack.cmake files
	  to expose access to select the package generator mechanism
	  through cmake CPACK_GENERATOR option. The user can specify the
	  type of package generator (i.e. rpms. deb, NSIS, tar, zip, etc)
	  that they would like to use from the CPack supported
	  packages/installation methods.
	  
	  I also changed the CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME to use
	  OSG_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME which contains the name of each component
	  so all of the component packages can be generated without
	  renaming the files.
	  
	  This should make it even easier to create distribution packages
	  for the various linux, windows and mac distribution methods
	  supported by CPack."

2010-12-14 08:58  robert

	* Moved Performer and Inventor plugins into block protected to only
	  compile when not using GLES.

2010-12-14 08:53  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "A modified version is attached. The blank while
	  generating is in fact
	  used to avoid dual update traversals of the scene, which is not
	  allowed in my application (but I forgot the reason ;-) Now the
	  blank
	  problem will disappear.
	  
	  Inactive mode is also available, using the --inactive mode and

	  examples from CMakeLists.txt

2010-12-13 17:50  robert

	* Moved osgviewerQT and osgviewQtWidget to deprecated as

2010-12-13 13:41  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-12-13 13:37  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attachment is an example of rendering 3D scenes
	  to high resolution screenshots.
	  
	  I uses a queue of Camera objects to do offscreen rendering with
	  the Camera::attach() function. The entire picture is split into
	  many tiles and it will take a few seconds while attaching and
	  detaching cameras with tiles. You may select to output every tile
	  as an image file, or combine them together to create a large
	  poster, for example, a 12800 x 9600 image.
	  
	  Start the program like this:
	  
	  ./osgposter --output-poster --poster output.bmp --tilesize 800
	  600 --finalsize 8000 6000 cow.osg
	  
	  Adjust the scene camera to a suitable position and press 'p' or

2010-12-13 12:16  robert

	* Form Richard Schmidt, "The following features were added:

2010-12-13 11:34  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I implemented a customized viewer event traversal
	  here to read state
	  changes from the DirectInput devices and add events to the event
	  queue. I've tested with the keyboard and joystick supports.
	  Because of
	  only having a very old 6-button gamepad, I can't do more
	  experiments.
	  Hope this will bring more ideas to those who face similar
	  problems,
	  especially simulation game designers. :)
	  
	  I didn't map all DirectInput key values to GUIEventAdapter key
	  symbols. Users may add more in the buildKeyMap() function freely.
	  The
	  mouse handling operations are also ignored, but will be easily
	  improved in the same way of creating keyboard and joystick

	  Please add a line:

2010-12-13 10:46  robert

	* From Eduardo Poyart, "The attached patch fixes a race condition

	  the subtile that was just loaded. To fix the problem
	  getArchiveName
	  will only return existing archives. createArchiveName was added
	  to
	  create archives.

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "As suggested I have added missing
	  method to PerContextProgram. Tested with our programs.
	  
	  I see that we should expect some performance penalty for using
	  this method. It won’t be painful in my current case because I
	  have only a few animated characters. But I suspect some day I
	  will have to fix osgCal to use int UniformIds natively for larger
	  crowds."

2010-12-12 08:56  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've found a possible bug in the new
	  SmoothingVisitor implementation
	  (with a great 'crease angle' feature), which will crash if the
	  normal
	  array is already set but without BIND_PER_VERTEX. I just believe
	  that
	  we should reallocate the normal array in these cases, as the old
	  implementation does.
	  "

2010-12-12 08:54  robert

	* Introuced a local typedef of the index array type to keep the
	  functor parameters consistent

2010-12-11 15:12  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "Here a small fix about gdal plugin used to
	  read dem file, if you dont
	  setup the log level to INFO it does not work. It's because of
	  this line:
	  OSG_INFO << " GetGeoTransform == "<<
	  dataset->GetGeoTransform(geoTransform)<<"
	  
	  I have just put the function outside of an stream stuff, and it
	  works.
	  It's possible we have other code like that in other plugins, I
	  guess
	  it's a side effect of the MACRO stuff about notification."

2010-12-10 15:27  robert

	* Refactor of DatabasePage/IncrementalCompileOperation to use the
	  IncrementalCompileOperator for compiling objects

2010-12-10 13:22  robert

	* Build fixes to keep up with changes in head inclusions/API in
	  osgDB

2010-12-09 12:16  robert

	* Added handling of CoordinateSystemNode when they decorate a
	  loaded model, copying the contents of the CoordinateSystemNode
	  across to the Terrain node

2010-12-08 11:01  robert

	* Updated version number for 2.9.11 dev release

2010-12-08 10:34  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached are patches to osgTerrain that
	  fix some typos and add a bit of documentation.
	  "

2010-12-08 09:54  robert

	* Added protection against the Registry from being deleted prior to
	  the proxy objects unregistering themselves

2010-12-08 09:52  robert

	* Fixes for benign threading memory contentions.

2010-12-06 10:35  robert

	* Renamed YES and NO enums with more description names that don't
	  overlap with iOS #define's

2010-12-03 19:04  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS for release

2010-12-03 17:50  robert

	* From Johannes Bauerle, "When trying to use the osgText
	  functionality in an osg application built without support for the
	  fixed function pipeline I got a lot of warning messages about
	  invalid calls.
	  I found two indirect calls to the glTexEnv in the file Text.cpp:
	  
	  state.applyTextureAttribute(0,getActiveFont()->getTexEnv());
	  
	  In the attached fix I surrounded these calls with #ifdef's
	  checking for OSG_GL_FIXED_FUNCTION_AVAILABLE to ensure that the
	  above function is only called when the fixed function pipeline is
	  available.
	  "

2010-12-03 17:20  robert

	* Removed redundent call.

2010-12-03 14:24  robert

	* Commented out debug message

2010-12-03 14:18  robert

	* Introduced bool Texture2D::textureObjectValid(State) and bool
	  SubloadCallback::textureObjectValid(Texture2D&,State&) method to
	  make it tell Texture2D::apply() whether the texture object is
	  still valid or whether it's no longed valid for the any changes
	  to the image attached to the Texture

2010-12-02 14:20  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "Attached; here's a summary of the changes:
	  - CMakeLists.txt
	  -- don't look for GL when compiling for iOS (device or
	  simulator), look for OGLES instead
	  -- use architecture i386 for simulator
	  -- removed iphoneos-version-min for simulator
	  
	  - examples/osgviewerIPhone/CMakeLists.txt
	  -- added build dependencies for osgdb_osg, osgdb_freetype,
	  osgdb_imageio
	  -- added framework QuartzCore link dependency
	  
	  - src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt
	  -- don't link against Carbon on iOS (device or simulator)
	  
	  - src/osgPlugins/freetype/CMakeLists.txt

	  "

2010-12-02 14:13  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached are most of the fixes that are
	  required to build osg on solaris and
	  hpux. I have skipped irix this time as irix is too dead to keep
	  osg building
	  there.
	  
	  As usual, solaris does not like member templates in stl
	  containers.
	  Some headers missing and link problems due to missing libraries."

2010-12-02 14:01  robert

	* Ran dos2unix to fix line endings

2010-12-02 13:53  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, commented out debug messages

2010-12-02 09:39  robert

	* Removed redudent makeCurrentImplementation() that was causing a
	  crash in osgscreencapture.

2010-12-01 20:14  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS and Contributors.cpp to reflect new ChangeLog
	  correctly

2010-12-01 19:49  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "OK, I dug a bit into the CMake scripts and
	  found a fairly obvious solution to the QtWebkit issue on RHEL 6
	  (see my other message on osg-users). I just moved the
	  osgQtWidgets example in examples/CMakeLists.txt under the check
	  for QtWebKit.
	  
	  Fix is attached:"

2010-12-01 14:03  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2010-12-01 13:33  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "I use Texture2D::copyTexImage2D to
	  generate some textures at each frame on a PagedLOD databases.
	  There was some performance problems after a long run, because
	  textures created with copyTexImage2D were not reused.
	  After investigation, there is a problem with the Texture Pool
	  when a texture object is created with an empty profile, and then
	  move after creation to TextureObjectSet with good profile using
	  setAllocated method.
	  I have just changed a little bit the code of
	  Texture2D::copyTexImage2D, to generate the texture object with
	  the good profile at the start."

2010-11-30 16:22  robert

	* From "Matthew Roberso, I've attached a small fix to the
	  src/osgWrappers/serializers/osg/Texture2DArray.cpp against the
	  svn head r11965 it simply calls setTextureDepth before attempting
	  to load the individual textures into the array. Currently without
	  that the loading fails with the following printout "Warning:
	  Texture2DArray::setImage(..) failed, the given layer number is
	  bigger then the size of the texture array." and the texture array
	  is empty if loaded from an osga/b."

2010-11-30 14:36  robert

	* Fixed the readObject method so it could handle reading from a
	  file contains any valid type of osg::Object

2010-11-30 12:34  robert

	* Added passing of existingObj parameter

2010-11-30 11:34  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, compile fix for iOS

2010-11-30 09:26  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein and Stephan Huber, improves to iOS build

2010-11-30 08:12  robert

	* From Wang Rui, Compile fixes

2010-11-29 17:43  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "Here is initial support for uniform buffer
	  objects. The binding between a buffer object and an indexed
	  target is implemented as a new StateAttribute,
	  UniformBufferBinding. I've included an example program based on
	  the code in the ARB_uniform_buffer_object specification.
	  
	  A few things remain to do:
	  * The binding between a uniform block in a shader program and a
	  buffer indexed target number is fixed, like a vertex attribute
	  binding. This is too restrictive because that binding can be
	  changed without relinking the program. This mapping should be
	  done by name in the same way that uniform values are handled
	  i.e., like a pseudo state attribute;
	  
	  * There's no direct way yet to query for the offset of uniforms
	  in uniform block, so only the std140 layout is really usable. A
	  helper class that implemented the std140 rules would be quite
	  helpful for setting up uniform blocks without having to link a
	  program first;
	  
	  * There's no direct support for querying parameters such as the
	  maximum block length, minimum offset alignment, etc. Having that
	  information available outside of the draw thread would make
	  certain instancing techniques easier to implement."

2010-11-29 09:32  robert

	* Removed deperecated variables that are no longer used.

2010-11-26 18:19  robert

	* From Tomas Holgarth and Stephan Huber, "
	  attached you'll find the second part of the IOS-submission. It
	  contains
	  
	  * GraphicsWindowIOS, which supports external and "retina"
	  displays,
	  multisample-buffers (for IOS > 4.0) and multi-touch-events
	  * an ios-specific implementation of the imageio-plugin
	  * an iphone-viewer example
	  * cMake support for creating a xcode-project
	  * an updated ReadMe-file describing the necessary steps to get a
	  working xcode-project-file from CMake
	  
	  Please credit Thomas Hogarth and Stephan Huber for these changes.
	  
	  This brings the ios-support in line with the git-fork on github.
	  It
	  needs some more testing and some more love, the cmake-process is
	  still a
	  little complicated.
	  
	  You'll need a special version of the freetype lib compiled for
	  IOS,
	  there's one bundled in the OpenFrameworks-distribution, which can
	  be used."
	  
	  Notes, from Robert Osfield, modified CMakeLists.txt files so that
	  the IOS specific paths are within IF(APPLE) blocks.

2010-11-26 17:37  robert

	* From Katharina Plugge, fix for regression in handling of
	  multitexturing.

2010-11-26 17:35  robert

	* From Eduardo Poyart, OSG patch: made it read ancillary
	  IndexedStrings into MultiSwitch

2010-11-26 17:32  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2010-11-26 13:54  robert

	* From Marin Platings and Robert Osfield, fix of Uniform unique ID
	  by making osg::Object::setName() virtual.

2010-11-26 12:44  robert

	* From Martin Beck, "
	  recently we noticed a little mistake for 3DS files using
	  instances of the same meshs: Every groupnode gets the same name
	  instead of the (correct) instance name of the object. The fix
	  only consists of two additional lines which check whether an
	  instance_name is given for the object and then uses this one
	  instead of the node name."

2010-11-26 12:23  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "There was a small bug when using the new
	  serializer with AnimationPath. The serializer assumes NO_LOOPING
	  is the defaut for LoopMode, but in fact it is LOOP.
	  The new serializer avoids to write default values in text mode,
	  so the loop mode is not always correctly set."
	  

2010-11-26 12:22  robert

	* Removed debug messages

2010-11-26 10:31  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "Typo in usage string of
	  examples/osganalysis
	  
	  please specifies -> please specify"

2010-11-25 16:06  robert

	* From Thomas Hogarth and Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find part
	  one of iphone-support. It includes
	  
	  * support for NPOT-textures on IOS
	  * support for FBOs (only renderToTexture for now) on IOS (should
	  work
	  for other OpenGL ES 1/2 targets, too)
	  * FileUtils-support for IOS"

2010-11-25 13:00  robert

	* From Tim Moore, fix to stats timing

2010-11-25 12:30  robert

	* From Michael Platings, To address performance bottleneck that
	  occurs when using large number of uniforms introduced a name to
	  uniqued ID scheme for Uniforms so comparisons can be done on a
	  uint rather than a string.

2010-11-25 12:07  robert

	* From Hartwig Wiesmann, "in the files Image, Observer and
	  TerrainTechnique unused parameters exist resulting in a couple of
	  compiler warnings (depending on the compiler settings though).
	  The attached patches comment out the unused parameter names.
	  "

2010-11-25 11:59  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "applications/osgconv: fix typo in tool
	  options
	  
	  transprent -> transparent"

2010-11-25 11:40  robert

	* Removed default assignement of GeometryTechnique as the
	  TerrainTechniquePrototype.

2010-11-24 20:26  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to provide a quick updates of the new
	  tessellation shader
	  serializers and dotosgwrappers. It includes reading/writing
	  supports
	  for the two new shader types and the GL_PATCHES enum. The
	  setParameterfv() method is not wrapped at present because it is
	  still
	  not finished.
	  
	  Enum serialziers don't require back-compatibility checks if only
	  add/remove enum items, so I'm not going to use the new
	  UPDATE_TO_VERSION macro this time."

2010-11-24 20:20  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, build fixes for windows.

2010-11-24 17:01  robert

	* Added workaround for AMD/ATI driver bug

2010-11-24 10:38  robert

	* From Tim Moore, Fix for drivers that don't properly support timer
	  extensions.
	  
	  ""

2010-11-24 10:09  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "1: fix for a issue with
	  MinimalShadowMap and LightSpacePerspectiveShadowMapVB techniques
	  ignoring minLightMargin parameter.
	  2: minor tweak for a DebugHUD drawn improperly case when multiple
	  slave views shared one window. It now uses slave view viewport to
	  correctly position DebugHUD.
	  3: deactivated ConvexPolyhedron notifications (they were
	  accidentaly activated when you replaced osg::notify calls with
	  OSG_NOTIFY macro). These warnings are useful only for shadow map
	  developer working on shadow volume optimizations. So there is no
	  sense in having them active all the time."

2010-11-23 17:33  robert

	* Moved TextNode from osgText into example/osgtext3D in prep for
	  3.0

2010-11-23 14:50  robert

	* From Holger Helmich, Tessellation shader support

2010-11-23 11:11  robert

	* From David Callu, "Here a fix for pssm.
	  
	  Problem 1 :
	  With GLSL, multi pass to apply each shadow map is not required.
	  
	  
	  Problem 2 :
	  GLSL code use "shadow2DProj" build-in function to look up in
	  shadow texture.
	  Projection is orthogonal so "shadow2D" build-in function is
	  sufficient.
	  
	  Problem 3:
	  Bad calcul in
	  osgShadow::ParallelSplitShadowMap::calculateLightViewProjectionFormFrustum(..)
	  provide some visual error in specific configuration.
	  
	  
	  to reproduce pssm_bug.jpg, you need to add a light direction in
	  osgshadow.cpp example (done in joint osgshadow.cpp file)
	  then "osgshadow --noUpdate --pssm --maxFarDist 500 --minNearSplit
	  500 --mapcount 6 --debug-color model_test.3ds"
	  
	  
	  As you can see in pssm_bug.jpg and pssm_fix.jpg, performance is
	  really better when Problem 1 is fixed.
	  "

2010-11-22 19:38  robert

	* Build fixes for building OSG with
	  OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION set to OFF

2010-11-22 19:18  robert

	* Fixed typo

2010-11-22 17:39  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "the attached cmake file recognises the
	  latest version of the FBX SDK, and now works correctly on 64 bit
	  Windows."

2010-11-22 17:37  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "the build is broken if you have the
	  OSG_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION turned off - the attached
	  files fix this."

2010-11-22 17:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a proposal for handling
	  multi-touch-events with
	  osgGA. My approach is to bundle all touchpoints into one custom
	  data
	  structure which is attached to an GUIEventAdapter.
	  
	  The current approach simulates a moving mouse for the first
	  touch-point,
	  so basic manipulators do work, sort of.
	  
	  I created a MultiTouchTrackballManipulator-class, one touch-point
	  does
	  rotate the view, two touch-points pan and zoom the view as known
	  from
	  the iphone or other similar multi-touch-devices. A double-tap
	  (similar
	  to a double-click) resets the manipulator to its home-position.
	  
	  The multi-touch-trackball-implementation is not the best, see it
	  as a
	  first starting point. (there's a demo-video at
	  http://vimeo.com/15017377 )"

2010-11-22 15:52  robert

	* Fixed indentation

2010-11-22 11:31  robert

	* From Johan Nouvel, "I've attached ReaderWriterVRML2.h. It is the
	  same as the previous one, I've just add supportsOption() calls."

2010-11-22 11:22  robert

	* Fixed typo of commercial

2010-11-22 10:41  robert

	* From Hartwig Wiesmann, fix to font search path under OSX.

2010-11-22 10:37  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "Attached is a very small change to allow
	  the Collada libs for VS 2010 to be found automatically."

2010-11-19 18:26  robert

	* From Katherina Plugge, "if using multitexturing and converting
	  osg files to OpenFlight texture coordinates get corrupted. The
	  texture coordinates for slot 1 and following are not computed
	  correctly (see thread
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=6993).
	  
	  The attached files solve the problem.
	  "

2010-11-19 18:07  robert

	* From Sukender, fix for precision of Plane::asVec4()

2010-11-19 17:47  robert

	* Commented out debug output

2010-11-19 17:47  robert

	* Update SOVERSION

2010-11-19 09:57  robert

	* Update Text wrappers to handle new Color member

2010-11-19 09:57  robert

	* Updated SO version to reflect changes in API of osgText

2010-11-18 17:59  robert

	* Moved text color into TextBase, added support for colour into
	  Text3D

2010-11-18 17:18  robert

	* Added resetting of the freetype size when getting Glyph3D glyph's
	  as otherwise use of 2D and 3D Text would cause incorrect text
	  sizing.

2010-11-18 12:03  robert

	* Improved handling of pending orphaned texture objects and max
	  texture pool size.

2010-11-17 14:06  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, Changed debug info in
	  State::frameCompleted() to OSG_INFO

2010-11-17 10:19  robert

	* Added texture pool handler to print out results from texture pool

2010-11-17 10:16  robert

	* Added quite size test.

2010-11-15 17:21  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "added the following to the ADD_LIBRARY
	  list -- ${OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSIONINFO_RC}"

2010-11-12 11:04  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-11-12 09:48  robert

	* Fixed crash on intialization of static applications by moving the
	  static mutexes inside singleton methods.

2010-11-11 16:51  robert

	* Moved finding of RSVG, Poppler-glib and GtkGl out into their own
	  Find*.cmake modules to enable easier specialization.

2010-11-11 11:47  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've finally completed the static build support
	  for dotosg wrapper and
	  serialization libraries. My submission mainly includes:
	  1. Add two new macros USE_DOTOSGWRAPPER_LIBRARY and
	  USE_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER_LIBRARY. Applications using static OSG
	  must
	  include corresponding static-link libraries and use these two
	  macros
	  to predefine native format wrappers. Please see osgstaticviewer
	  and
	  present3D in the attachment for details.
	  
	  2. Add a LibraryWrapper.cpp file in each
	  osgWrappers/deprecated-dotosg/... and osgWrappers/serializers/...
	  subfolder, which calls all USE_...WRAPPERS macros inside. The
	  LibraryWrapper file is automatically generated by the
	  wrapper_includer.cpp (with some slight fixes), which is also
	  attached
	  for your reference. The deprecated-dotosg/osgAnimation is not
	  included
	  because it doesn't us REGISTER_DOTOSGWRAPPER to define its
	  wrappers.
	  
	  3. Modify the ReaderWriterOSG.cpp to prevent calling
	  loadWrappers()
	  when static build.
	  
	  4. An uncorrelated fix to Serializer and ObjectWrapper.cpp, which
	  ensures version variables of serialziers are initialized, and
	  serializers out-of-version are not written to model files.
	  "

2010-11-11 10:53  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The latest modification of osg/State uses the
	  GLuint64EXT type, which
	  belongs to GL_EXT_timer_query and should be decalared to avoid
	  compiling errors if the extension is not supported. I've attached
	  this
	  small fix."

2010-11-11 10:42  robert

	* From Mark Sciabica, "It's not Windows API calls that are causing
	  the problem. It's a new
	  templated constructor of std::pair not being able to
	  automatically
	  convert 0 to a pointer. Rather than use preprocessor checks and
	  #defines, I think a cleaner solution is to cast the std::pair
	  arguments
	  to the appropriate types to help the compiler out. I attached an
	  updated
	  version of the file implementing this."

2010-11-10 16:58  robert

	* From Tim More and Robert Osfield, implementation of
	  ARB_timer_query based GPU timing stats syncronization.
	  
	  Initial email from Tim : "I've implemented using a timestamp,
	  available with ARB_timer_query and OpenGL 3.3, to gather GPU
	  stats. This is nice because it can accurately fix the GPU draw
	  time with respect to the other times on the stats graph, rather
	  than having to estimate the wall time of the end of GPU drawing.
	  This also prevents anomalies like the GPU phase starting before
	  the draw phase..."
	  Changes to Tim's submission by Robert: Removal of need for swap
	  buffer callback in ViewerBase.cpp, by
	  integrating a osg::State::frameCompleted() method that does the
	  stats timing collection. Introduction of a
	  GraphicsContext::swapBuffersCallbackOrImplementation() method
	  that calls the State::frameCompleted() and
	  the swap buffers callback or the swapImplementation as required.

2010-11-10 12:50  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "This is a small fix to
	  osg::createGeodeForImage to adapt Tex coords to image origin.
	  
	  "

2010-11-09 17:17  robert

	* Added traversal of salve camera subgraphs when the slave camera
	  doesn't share it's scene graph wiht the View's master scene

	* From Wang Rui with small tweak from Robert Osfield, fix of memory
	  leak in gif plugin when using GifImageStream

2010-11-09 14:57  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'm now testing static building of OSG and found
	  a possible bug in the
	  present3D application. As static-link present3d should depend on
	  freetype, png, pdf and some other plugins, any mis-compiling of
	  these
	  plugins will make present3d fail to be built. Some lirbaries like
	  poppler and cairo are not popular under Windows, so it is very
	  common
	  that we don't have osgdb_pdf compiled and thus get errors when
	  building present3d. I've modified the CMakeLists and
	  present3d.cpp to
	  avoid this problem."

2010-11-09 14:39  robert

	* From Sukender, "As discussed in osg-users, I found output
	  directories with CMake >= 2.8.1 are wrong under MSVC (As Chuck
	  said, it's to be related to CMake, and not MSVC).
	  
	  But I also found rev. 11354 (from Wang Rui) added a change in
	  OsgMacroUtils which adresses a similar issue: Wang told the
	  "../../bin" prefix wasn't working. However I think the fix isn't
	  correct because it checks the MSVC version instead of the CMake
	  version. Here is my fix, against latest trunk (root
	  CMakeLists.txt, and CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake).
	  
	  Tests I made:
	  | Unix Makefiles | MSVC 9 | MSVC 10 x64
	  ---------------------------------------------------
	  CMake 2.4 | | OK | N/A
	  CMake 2.6.4 | | OK | N/A
	  CMake 2.8.0 | | OK | broken support?
	  CMake 2.8.2 | | OK | OK

	* Refactored the versioning of serializers so it now uses a
	  _firstVersion and _lastVersion make it possible
	  to specify what range of versions support each serializer.

2010-11-09 12:41  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit my latest modification of the
	  serialization IO
	  functionalities. It includes two main parts: a version checking
	  macro
	  for handling backward-compatiblity since 3.0, and enhencement of
	  current schema mechanism. I also change the option handling
	  process to
	  use getPluginStringData(), and add new USE_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER
	  macro in
	  the Registry header to allow for static-link usage as well.
	  
	  The enhencement of schema machanism just tells the type of each
	  serializer while outputting them, such as:
	  osg::Group = Children:1
	  
	  The meaning of the number can be found in the osgDB/Serializer
	  header,
	  BaseSerializer::Type enum. It may help 3rdparty utilities
	  understand
	  the structure of the wrapper and do some reflection work in the
	  future.
	  
	  The new macro UPDATE_TO_VERSION can help indicate the InputStream
	  (no
	  affect on the writer) that a serializer is added/removed since
	  certain
	  OSG version. An example wrapper file is also attached. The
	  Geode_modified.cpp is based on the serializers/osg/Geode.cpp file
	  (hey, don't merge it :-), but assumes that a new user serializer
	  'Test' is added since version 65 (that is, the OSG_SOVERSION):
	  
	  REGISTER_OBJECT_WRAPPER( Geode, ... )
	  {
	  ADD_USER_SERIALIZER( Drawables ); // origin ones
	  
	  UPDATE_TO_VERSION( 65 )
	  {
	  ADD_USER_SERIALIZER( Test ); // a serializer added from version
	  65
	  }
	  }
	  
	  All kinds of ADD_... macros following UPDATE_TO_VERSION will
	  automatically apply the updated version. The braces here are only
	  for
	  typesetting!
	  While reading an osgt/osgb/osgx file, OSG will now check if the
	  file
	  version (recorded as the writer's soversion, instead of previous
	  meaningless "#Version 2") is equal or greater than Test's
	  version, and
	  try reading it, or just ignore it if file version is lesser.
	  
	  And we also have the REMOVE_SERIALIZER macro will mark a named
	  serializer as removed in some version, with which all files
	  generated
	  by further versions will just ignore it:
	  
	  UPDATE_TO_VERSION( 70 )
	  {
	  REMOVE_SERIALIZER( Test );
	  }
	  
	  This means that from version 70, the serializer Test is removed
	  (but
	  not actually erased from the list) and should not be read
	  anymore. If
	  the read file version is less than 70 (and equal or greater than
	  65),
	  Test will still be handled when reading; otherwise it will be
	  ignored
	  to keep compatiblity on different OSG versions.

	* From Johan Nouvel, "Some times ago, I have coded an osg to vrml2
	  writer. Today, I have updated our writer to osg 2.9.9.
	  As it works (for our needs at least) I've done and attached a
	  tar.gz file for the VRML2 plugin with a new part to write a VRML2
	  file from an osg one.
	  
	  The read part is the same as in osg 2.9.9.
	  
	  The write part code is in convertToVRML.cpp and .h files. It
	  works for some osg nodes (group, geode, matrixTransform,
	  positionAttitudeTransform and geometry). Textures are converted
	  to jpeg (if not translucent) or png (if translucent).
	  There are some options that could be given to the writer (with -O
	  switch) :
	  
	  convertTextures=0 to copy textures without converting them to
	  jpeg or png
	  convertTextures=-1 do not copy textures, keep them in their
	  original format and location
	  convertTextures=-2 do not use textures, parse only geometry
	  convertTextures=-3 (default) convert textures to jpeg or png
	  ones.
	  
	  textureUnit=X in case of multiple textures, X= texture unit to
	  use (default value=0)
	  
	  directoryTexture=aPath when texture will be copied, it will be in
	  this directory, not in the current one."

2010-11-08 12:28  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "As promised, here is the fix for the
	  background size. I also added another instance variable
	  _lineHeight to clean up the code a bit more.
	  
	  Also I've done the osguserstats example. I've kept the "toy
	  example" that was in the modified osgviewer.cpp I had sent you,
	  because they show different uses of custom stats lines (a value
	  displayed directly, a value without bars and a value with bars
	  and graph). I also added a function and a thread that will sleep
	  for a given number of milliseconds and record this time in the
	  stats. I think it clearly shows how to record the time some
	  processing takes and add that to the stats graph, whether the
	  processing takes place on the same thread as the viewer or on
	  another thread.
	  
	  BTW, feel free to modify the colors I've given to each user stats
	  line... I'm not very artistic. :-)
	  
	  I've also added more doc comments to the addUserStats() method in
	  ViewerEventHandlers, so hopefully the arguments are clear and the
	  way to get the results you want is also clear. Maybe I went
	  overboard, but the function makes some assumptions that may not
	  be obvious and has many arguments, so I preferred to be
	  explicit."

2010-11-05 17:24  robert

	* From Javier Taibo, "ere is the new code with Billboard "rotate
	  around axis" functionality.
	  
	  A new AutoRotateMode was added. I named it ROTATE_TO_AXIS to be
	  consistent with the other AutoRotateModes, even though it changes
	  from
	  how is called in Billboard (AXIAL_ROT).
	  
	  Setters and getters for rotation axis and normal were also added
	  to the
	  AutoTransform class interface.
	  
	  The implementation is mainly a copy-paste from Billboard code.

	* From Sukender, "1. More handled cases in MergeGeometryVisitor
	  - Algorithm doesn't try to merge double and single precision

	  - Algorithm doesn't try to merge incompatible geometries (ex: one
	  with "vertices + texoords", and another with only vertices)
	  
	  2. Better TextureAtlasBuilder

	  ReadDDSFile warning: couldn't read mipmapData
	  
	  The issue is caused, when the last block of data is read from the

	* From Jan Klimke, "I did recently some work understanding the

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a small change to the DirectShow

	* From Wang Rui, "additional FFmpegParameters class in the ffmpeg

	  ReaderWriter implementation.
	  
	  Now we can use ffmpeg to render webcam video (using the vfwcap
	  device) under Windows:
	  
	  osgmovie 0 -e ffmpeg -O "format=vfwcap frame_rate=25"
	  
	  The number 0 just indicates a default device number in ffmpeg.
	  
	  I think this can work under Linux, too, and should be a bit
	  better than comparing the filename with a '/dev/' string. Just
	  type:
	  
	  ./osgmovie /dev/yourcam -e ffmpeg -O "format=video4linux2

2010-11-03 10:04  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "For a long time now I've wanted to be
	  able to add custom values into the stats handler's graph. Here is
	  my proposal of how I'd do this. It's surely not perfect and I'm
	  open to suggestions, but I've already made more changes than I
	  wanted to in order to be able to implement this...
	  
	  The user calls statsHandler->addUserStatsLine() providing:
	  
	  - the label they want for that line in the graph
	  - the text and bar colors they want in the graph
	  - the stats names they want queried (one for time taken, one for
	  begin and one for end time) and a few settings for how these will
	  be displayed.
	  
	  Then all they have to do is call
	  viewer->getViewerStats()->setAttribute(framenumber, name, value)
	  for their three attributes each frame and they'll have their
	  stats in the graph.
	  
	  They can also give only a time taken attribute (or some other
	  numerical value they want printed, which can be averaged or not),
	  or only begin+end attributes, and the graph will accordingly
	  display only the (average or not) numerical value or only the
	  bars.
	  
	  Along the way I cleaned up the existing code a bit:
	  
	  * Each time the setUpScene() or createCameraTimeStats() methods
	  added a line to the graph, they did pretty much the same thing,
	  so I moved that into a separate method called
	  createTimeStatsLine() which is called by setUpScene() and
	  createCameraTimeStats().
	  
	  * I moved the font, characterSize, startBlocks and leftPos
	  variables to member variables, since they were being passed
	  around everywhere but were set only once at the beginning.
	  
	  * The geode on which stats lines are added is also kept in a
	  member variable, and createCameraTimeStats() adds the per-camera
	  lines to this geode instead of returning a new Group with a new
	  Geode. This further reduces the number of variables the
	  createCameraTimeStats() method needs as input.
	  
	  "

2010-11-03 09:51  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "For a while now I've been bugged (pun)
	  by a problem in the stats graph I submitted a long time ago. When
	  it scrolled, sometimes it would scroll too little, leading to an
	  empty space at the left that would grow as time went by. I was in
	  that code today for something else so I fixed it.

	  OpenGL version string: 3.3.0 NVIDIA 256.35
	  
	  I went ahead and initialized some of the other variables before

	* From Jan Peciva, "attaching Matrix_implementation fix for two
	  problems:
	  
	  - using m.getPerspective( fovy, tmp, tmp, tmp ) to get only FOV
	  does not work.
	  The reason is that getPerspective is taking tmp as reference -
	  thus all the three variables points to the same memory location.
	  Then, zNear (third parameter) is used inside the method, while
	  zNear content was spoiled by zFar that was written to the same
	  place, resulting in fovy set to nan. I consider that it is the
	  right of programmers to use 3 times tmp as parameter and I fixed
	  the code in the method. I have done the same for getFrustum and
	  getLookAt.
	  
	  - I fixed makeFrustum to accept infinite zFar. (Some graphics
	  techniques like shadow volumes require placing zFar to infinity
	  to avoid visual artifacts.)"
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, change the local near & far variable
	  names to temp_near and temp_far MS Visual Studio has a record of
	  using near and far names.

	* From Wang Rui, QT based OpenThreads implementation

2010-10-13 15:03  robert

	* Added support for using a custom osg::Geometry that attempts to
	  force the OpenGL driver
	  to download the texture object to graphics card.
	  
	  Calling
	  IncrementalCompileOperation::assignForceTextureDownloadGeometry()
	  assigns a geometry
	  to the job.

2010-10-09 11:51  robert

	* Changed the _ARB cube map defines to non ARB versions.

	  also in include/osg/Texture

2010-10-08 18:53  robert

	* Tempory fix for regression due to remove of
	  glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib

2010-10-08 18:13  robert

	* Disabled the build of Qt examples when building against GLES1 & 2
	  as Qt GL includes OpenGL headers itself that cause conflict.

2010-10-08 17:13  robert

	* Build fixes for GLES1, GLES2 and GL3

2010-10-08 11:20  robert

	  gluBuild3DMipmaps and gluBuild3DMipmapLevels.

2010-10-07 11:53  robert

	* Introduced osg namespace to new local GLU functions

2010-10-07 10:51  robert

	* Introduced new gluScaleImage function that uses a
	  PixelStorageModes structure to pass in details on image packing,
	  rather than relying upon glGet's to get the values.

2010-10-06 19:09  robert

	* Added #define GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D

2010-10-06 18:51  robert

	* Fixed warning

2010-10-06 18:37  robert

	* Changed tabs to 8 spaces

2010-10-06 18:34  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay and Robert Osfield, build fix for
	  Windows

2010-10-06 18:29  robert

	* Added #define for Windows build

2010-10-06 17:19  robert

	* Added #define GLAPIENTRY to attempt to resolve some Windows build
	  issues

2010-10-06 16:36  robert

	* Added #define's and local include<osg/Image> to fix Windows GL
	  1.1 build against

2010-10-06 15:14  robert

	* Removed usage gluos.h and redundent gluint.h

2010-10-06 14:44  robert

	* Copied libutil and libtess implementations in form Mesa
	  7.9/src/glu into the src/osg/glu,
	  changed extensions from .c to .cpp and got compiling as C files
	  as part of the osg core library.
	  
	  Updated and cleaned up the rest of the OSG to use the new
	  internal GLU.

2010-10-04 15:23  robert

	* Improved the handling of matrices in serialization so that it's
	  more reliable,
	  change was to use doubles for reading and writing matrices
	  regardless of type of Matrix
	  being serialized.
	  
	  Change does break backwards compatibility though, so code
	  path supporting original format has been left in for the
	  time being. However, this code is not reliable enough and
	  is over complicated compared to the simplified handling. Once
	  the new code has been bedded down for a while I'll remove this
	  code block.

2010-10-04 11:29  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "just a follow-up: I looked at the code of
	  osg/Referenced.cpp and notice
	  a discrepancy in getOrCreateObserverSet. For the atomic- and
	  mutex-codepaths the newly created observerset gets manually
	  ref'ed, but
	  not in the codepath used when OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_MUTEX is
	  defined. I
	  added the manual ref and tadaaa, the crash went away."

2010-10-04 11:24  robert

	* Added glMultMatrixf path for GLES1

2010-10-04 11:19  robert

	* Added checks for NULL images to prevent crashes when no valid
	  images are created

2010-10-01 18:02  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "As promised I prepared a patch to
	  expose WGL_SWAP_METHOD / PFD_SWAP_METHOD selection via
	  GraphicsContext::Traits. Since Traits don't define any enums (I
	  guess to be simple to use) I tried to keep it that way and have
	  added two boolean values: swapCopy & swapExchange. It is somewhat
	  similar approach to GDI PixelFormatDescription were both options
	  can be present together. Feel free to replace it with enum if you
	  find it more appropriate.
	  
	  I also uderstand that there is a need to select system wide
	  default method and have also modified DisplaySettings to contain
	  swapMethod parameter. Swap method in Traits uses value set in
	  DisplaySettings as default. Proper environment and command line
	  args were added. Its possible to define default DeisplaySettings
	  swap method in standard way via system flags or with comand line.
	  
	  Env Vars:
	  OSG_SWAP_METHOD = DEFAULT | COPY | EXCHANGE
	  or Command Line:
	  --swap-method DEFAULT | COPY | EXCHANGE
	  
	  I also added handling of WM_ERASEBKGND in GraphicsWindowWin32. It
	  may be unneccessary but code should be safer this way than
	  without handling it. I have placed a comment explaining the
	  reason above the change.
	  
	  Changes were made against today trunk.
	  
	  PS. I tested only Windows code. I briefly checked X11 & Cocoa
	  files but have not noticed SwapMethod to be used there.
	  "

2010-10-01 17:07  robert

	* 

2010-10-01 15:58  robert

	* From Magnes Kessler, "Attached are some fixes for the environment
	  variable help strings in
	  DisplaySettings. They contain spelling fixes and an attempt to
	  use consistent
	  expressions throughout."

2010-10-01 15:37  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski,"These are our changes to
	  DatabasePager. To check if parent PLOD is registered, I
	  resurrected PagedLODList::containsPagedLOD() method. This method
	  was available some time ago, but got removed and was not
	  currently present in trunk. To add this method I had to also
	  modify the DatabasePager header. "

2010-09-30 16:57  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "After a closer look at this particular
	  issue, I used some grep and sed magic
	  to fix all occurrences of "macro's" and "paramter".
	  "

2010-09-30 16:31  robert

	* From Craig Bosma, "Attached is an updated Image.cpp that fixes a
	  very specific
	  compatability regression that was introduced almost 2 years ago
	  in
	  r8834. The IVE version number was bumped to 32 because of the
	  change
	  in binary layout, but the guard for reading/writing the new field
	  was
	  checked against 31. Of course this only causes a problem (as for
	  us)
	  when you've produced IVE files at version 31, which no longer
	  load (or
	  crash) when loaded by newer OSG/IVE versions."

2010-09-30 16:03  robert

	* From Chuck Seberino, "Here is a small optimization in
	  osgDB/Serializer that only uses a single accessor call when
	  retrieving serializable values during writing. This is a sizable
	  win for some of my code since the getter() methods are
	  non-trivial. I also removed some explicit namespace qualifiers to
	  be consistent with the rest of the codebase."

2010-09-30 14:25  robert

	* From WojciechLewandowski, Added DispaySettings::SwapMethod and
	  support for it in GraphicsContext::Traits

2010-09-30 09:40  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, fixed build under OSX 10.5.

2010-09-30 09:34  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've fixed the problem that osgx format doesn't
	  read the Font property and wrapped string correctly. The first
	  problem happened because the matchString() made a mistake in
	  comparing two strings with the same start but different size. The
	  second just needs complete rewriting of writeWrappedString() and
	  readWrappedString() in src/osgPlugins/osg/XmlStreamOperator.h
	  
	  I also fixed a possible bug in osgDB::XmlParser that doesn't
	  handle control characters (like &quot; to ") when reading node
	  attributes, because the writeWrappedString() and
	  readWrappedString() now depend heavily on control characters. An
	  additional improvement is that osgx now supports comments."

2010-09-29 13:21  robert

	* Fixed Text3D's handling of character aspect ratio.

2010-09-29 12:45  robert

	* Moved handling of character aspect ratio into osgText::Style.

2010-09-29 12:38  robert

	* Added command line option for writing out the scene graph to
	  file.

2010-09-29 11:34  robert

	* Moved set/getFont from Text/Text3D into TextBase

2010-09-29 11:09  robert

2010-09-29 10:54  robert

	* Fixed type of numberical constant

2010-09-27 17:11  robert

	* Moved Text3D across to using Style for character thickness.
	  Quitened down debug messages in 3D text geometry creation.
	  Improved the Text3D implementation of the new 3D text geometry.

2010-09-27 16:18  robert

	* Added support for osgText::Style into osgText::Text3D.
	  Refactored Text3D implementation to use new GlyphGeometry class.
	  Implemented GlyphGeometry backend and cleaned up Glyph3D
	  interface.

2010-09-27 09:58  robert

	* Changed the reading of animation paths so that it's always done
	  without using the osgDB object cache.
	  This fixes a bug of reusing the animination path in an P3D file.

2010-09-26 11:02  robert

	* Added include<osg/Geode> to fix compile error

2010-09-24 14:53  robert

	* From Alexander Wiebel, "I did some spell checking in my spare
	  time. Here come 20 files."

2010-09-24 14:40  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Changeset 10833 renames
	  discardAllDeletedGLObjects() to discardAllGLObjects() in
	  src/osg/GLObjects.cpp, but the declaration of the function in
	  include/osg/GLObjects remained. So an app using an old version of
	  OSG that called this function would now fail with a linker error
	  instead of a compile error as it should.
	  
	  Removed the declaration. Also fixed a small typo in the following
	  doxygen comment."

2010-09-24 14:38  robert

	* From Mikhail Izmestev, "This patch fixes operator >> used with
	  std::istream without std::ios::skipws flag. This allow using
	  boost::lexical_cast with osg vectors types, because boost's
	  lexical_cast disable std::ios::skipws flag of std::istream before
	  using operator >>.
	  "

2010-09-24 12:59  robert

	* From Eric Wing, QTKit plugin for reading movies under OSX using

2010-09-21 11:40  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and AUTHORS file for release

2010-09-21 10:28  robert

	* From David Guthrie, "The cocoa version of the window for Mac OS X
	  doesn't implement the requestWarpPointer function, but it turns
	  out that the code from the Carbon version of the window is the
	  same because it uses the windowing interface, so it this version,
	  based on 2.8.3 GraphicsWindowCocoa, I copied the function over.
	  The trunk version it also missing the function and the code looks
	  to be very similar, so I assume it will transfer simply enough.
	  "

2010-09-20 16:04  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "imageio was not spelled correctly when
	  registering the plugin, attached is a fixed version of
	  ReaderWriterImageIO.cpp."

2010-09-20 11:50  robert

	* From Wang Rui, reverted changes to osgPartcile that caused

2010-09-17 13:33  robert

	* Build fixes for when OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION
	  is disabled

2010-09-17 13:09  robert

	* Reverted changes from Vivien Delage as there were some
	  regressions discovered. Will need to revist this code to deal
	  with bugs that Vivien was tackling.

2010-09-17 11:20  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "I've added a command line switch
	  '--testOcclusion' that enables display of other models in
	  front and behind the outlined object."

2010-09-16 13:04  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "Changes to the quicktime plugin to remove
	  unused variables and an unused
	  static function."

2010-09-16 10:33  robert

	* From Alexander Wiebel, "I came across some functions in Vec* that
	  I thought could benefit from some
	  doxygen documentation. Additionally, I made the comment on
	  value_type more
	  meaningful (in my opinion)."

2010-09-16 09:49  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "I'm resubmitting a slightly different
	  version of the changes you left out for
	  osg/Camera. The ::glName issue masked the fact that the "(..)"
	  isn't handled
	  well in doxygen and leads to "(." in the generated files.
	  
	  I'm also submitting a minor documentation fix to
	  osgGA/DriveManipulator to get
	  it out of my patch queue ;)"

2010-09-16 09:09  robert

	* From March Sciabica, "Here is the solution I coded up over the
	  weekend. For improved
	  performance option, I added a flag to control whether the depth
	  writing
	  pass is performed.
	  
	  Since text is alpha-blended when rendering, it is placed in the
	  transparent bin and rendered back to front. Writing to the depth
	  buffer
	  should therefore be unnecessary. Indeed, rendering something
	  behind text
	  (or any blended object) after that object is drawn will give
	  incorrect
	  results whether the depth buffer is written or not. I therefore
	  think it
	  is safe to keep this option off by default. Users can turn it on
	  for any
	  special needs they have.
	  
	  I did not fix the existing backdrop implementations to work with
	  the new
	  code since this new method of rendering intrinsically handles
	  backdrops
	  correctly. Its results are more accurate than all of the existing
	  backdrop implementations. Its only downside is that it requires
	  two
	  passes if depth buffer updates are desired, whereas DEPTH_RANGE
	  and
	  POLYGON_OFFSET achieve their (less accurate) results in one pass.
	  The
	  NO_DEPTH_BUFFER method also only uses one pass, but it disables
	  depth
	  tests and not depth writes so will have serious problems if
	  anything is
	  drawn in front of the text before OR after the text is drawn.
	  
	  Given the better all-around behavior of the new method, I believe
	  the
	  other backdrop implementations can be safely removed. Code that
	  adjusts
	  the backdrop implementation will of course be broken if the
	  member
	  functions are removed. For this reason I left them in, but set
	  the new
	  rendering method as the default backdrop implementation. At the
	  very
	  least I think the old backdrop implementations should be
	  deprecated and
	  removed at a later date.
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, testing this submission with osgtext I
	  found that the
	  text would not render correctly when different text labels were
	  overlapping
	  in deth and screen space. I change _enableDepthWrites to default
	  to true and
	  found the that which artifacts still occurred around the alpha
	  blended edges
	  the artifacts where better than issue with occlusion of nearer
	  pixels that was
	  happening with _enableDepthWrites set to false.I therefore set
	  the
	  _enableDepthWrites to true as I feel it's the lesser of the two
	  artefacts.

2010-09-16 08:46  robert

	* From Mathias Fielder, "i found an issue with the serializer
	  writing shared arrays. At OutputStream::writeArray(), if the
	  currently latest array is shared the full array content will be
	  written.
	  The following code snippet will reproduce this issue:
	  
	  
	  Code:
	  
	  osg::Vec2 vec(0.f, 0.f);
	  osg::Array* sharedArray = new osg::Vec2Array(1, & vec);
	  
	  // create 2 geometries sharing same array
	  osg::Geometry* geom0 = new osg::Geometry;
	  osg::Geometry* geom1 = new osg::Geometry;
	  geom0->setVertexArray(sharedArray);
	  geom1->setVertexArray(sharedArray);
	  
	  osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> geode = new osg::Geode;
	  geode->addDrawable(geom0);
	  geode->addDrawable(geom1);
	  
	  std::stringstream buffer;
	  
	  // write node
	  osg::ref_ptr<osgDB::Options> options = new
	  osgDB::Options("Ascii");
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter* rw =
	  osgDB::Registry::instance()->getReaderWriterForExtension("osgt");
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::WriteResult wr = rw->writeNode(*geode,
	  buffer, options.get());
	  
	  // print result; array will be written twice with full content,
	  though with same ID
	  std::cout << buffer.str() << std::endl;
	  
	  // trying to read back node will print warnings about unmatched
	  properties
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::ReadResult rr = rw->readNode(buffer,
	  options.get());
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  To fix this i made a change in OutputStream::writeArray().
	  I think the same issue applies to OutputStream::writeObject(). So
	  i made the same change there.

2010-09-15 13:24  robert

	* From Paul de Repentigny, Commented out section of code that

2010-09-15 11:36  robert

	* From Laura Cerritelli, "I modified TXPPagedLOD::traverse to
	  prevent the terrain from inappropriately unloading the higher
	  level of detail tiles. It wasn?t updating the frame number of the
	  tile or the range it was traversing, causing
	  PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren to always consider the range
	  expired."

2010-09-15 11:32  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've fixed some pen-slips in
	  SharedStateManager.cpp, which writing the
	  last few examples for my to-be-finished book. I also do a minor
	  fix to

2010-09-15 11:27  robert

	* From Lukasz Izdebski, "I made some changes in OcclusionQueryNode
	  file.
	  I move declaration of classes TestResult, QueryGeometry from cpp

	  method.
	  
	  Now is possible to inherit from class OcclusionQueryNode."

2010-09-15 11:10  robert

	* Renamed file3ds and options member variables to _file3ds and
	  _options to avoid confusion and keep the code consistent with the
	  rest of the class/OSG.
	  
	  Added _option parameter to writeImageFile(..) call.

2010-09-15 10:50  robert

	* From Todd Furlong, "I made a couple of changes to the
	  osgFX::Outline class (SVN patch attached). I had a couple of
	  issues with it that I was trying to resolve:
	  
	  1. When an outline object was occluded by another object, the
	  backfacing wireframe was exposed. To fix that, I removed the
	  disabling of GL_DEPTH_TEST.
	  
	  2. In some cases, the outline color was the same color as the
	  geometry being drawn instead of the specified color. I'm not sure
	  I have completely fixed this issue, but I did make some changes
	  to match up to how we do a scribe effect."

2010-09-15 10:24  robert

	* Added https, ftp and ftps to list of supported server protocols,
	  and add ability for curl plugin to ignore the need for a server

2010-09-14 15:47  robert

	* Form Wang Rui, "An initial GLSL shader support of rendering
	  particles. Only the POINT
	  type is supported at present. The attached osgparticleshader.cpp
	  will
	  show how it works. It can also be placed in the examples folder.
	  But I
	  just wonder how this example co-exists with another two
	  (osgparticle
	  and osgparticleeffect)?
	  
	  Member variables in Particle, including _alive, _current_size and
	  _current_alpha, are now merged into one Vec3 variable. Then we
	  can
	  make use of the set...Pointer() methods to treat them as vertex
	  attribtues in GLSL. User interfaces are not changed.
	  
	  Additional methods of ParticleSystem are introduced, including
	  setDefaultAttributesUsingShaders(), setSortMode() and
	  setVisibilityDistance(). You can see how they work in
	  osgparticleshader.cpp.
	  
	  Additional user-defined particle type is introduced. Set the
	  particle
	  type to USER and attach a drawable to the template. Be careful
	  because
	  of possible huge memory consumption. It is highly suggested to
	  use
	  display lists here.
	  
	  The ParticleSystemUpdater can accepts ParticleSystem objects as
	  child
	  drawables now. I myself think it is a little simpler in
	  structure,
	  than creating a new geode for each particle system. Of course,
	  the
	  latter is still compatible, and can be used to transform entire
	  particles in the world.
	  
	  New particle operators: bounce, sink, damping, orbit and
	  explosion.
	  The bounce and sink opeartors both use a concept of domains, and
	  can
	  simulate a very basic collision of particles and objects.
	  
	  New composite placer. It contains a set of placers and emit
	  particles
	  from them randomly. The added virtual method size() of each
	  placer
	  will help determine the probability of generating.
	  
	  New virtual method operateParticles() for the Operator class. It
	  actually calls operate() for each particle, but can be overrode
	  to use
	  speedup techniques like SSE, or even shaders in the future.
	  
	  Partly fix a floating error of 'delta time' in emitter, program
	  and
	  updaters. Previously they keep the _t0 variable seperately and
	  compute
	  different copies of dt by themseleves, which makes some
	  operators,
	  especially the BounceOperator, work incorrectly (because the dt
	  in
	  operators and updaters are slightly different). Now a
	  getDeltaTime()
	  method is maintained in ParticleSystem, and will return the
	  unique dt
	  value (passing by reference) for use. This makes thing better,
	  but
	  still very few unexpected behavours at present...
	  
	  All dotosg and serialzier wrappers for functionalities above are
	  provided.
	  
	  ...
	  
	  According to some simple tests, the new shader support is
	  slightly
	  efficient than ordinary glBegin()/end(). That means, I haven't
	  got a
	  big improvement at present. I think the bottlenack here seems to
	  be
	  the cull traversal time. Because operators go through the
	  particle
	  list again and again (for example, the fountain in the shader
	  example
	  requires 4 operators working all the time).
	  
	  A really ideal solution here is to implement the particle
	  operators in
	  shaders, too, and copy the results back to particle attributes.
	  The
	  concept of GPGPU is good for implementing this. But in my
	  opinion, the
	  Camera class seems to be too heavy for realizing such
	  functionality in
	  a particle system. Myabe a light-weight ComputeDrawable class is
	  enough for receiving data as textures and outputting the results
	  to
	  the FBO render buffer. What do you think then?
	  
	  The floating error of emitters
	  (http://lists.openscenegraph.org/pipermail/osg-users-openscenegraph.org/2009-May/028435.html)
	  is not solved this time. But what I think is worth testing is
	  that we
	  could directly compute the node path from the emitter to the
	  particle
	  system rather than multiplying the worldToLocal and LocalToWorld
	  matrices. I'll try this idea later.

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "not sure how severe this is but I believe

	* Moved GL_RED and associated GL defines that aren't defined by

2010-09-09 16:49  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "osgWidget::WindowManager did nothing
	  in its keyUp event, and in particular didn't call any callbacks.
	  Since I wanted to have callbacks on keyUp, I copied what it does
	  on keyDown, which works for me. I could have just used keyDown
	  and saved myself the trouble, but you know me... :-)
	  
	  osgWidget::Input:
	  
	  [Functional changes]
	  - Previously, the field would be filled with spaces up to its max
	  length, and typing would just replace the spaces. Also, there was
	  a _textLength variable that kept track of the real length of text
	  in the field, since the osgText::Text's length just reflected the
	  length of spaces+text entered. This was not great, as you could
	  still select the spaces with the mouse and it just feels hacky.
	  So I changed it to only contain the text entered, no spaces, and
	  _textLength was removed since it's now redundant (the
	  osgText::Text's length is used instead).
	  - Fixed the selection size which (visually only) showed one more
	  character selected than what was really selected.
	  - Fixed selection by dragging the mouse, it would sometimes not
	  select the last character of the string.
	  - Cursor will now accurately reflect whether insert mode is
	  activated (block cursor) or we're in normal mode (line cursor)
	  like in most editors.
	  - Implemented Ctrl-X (cut)
	  - Added a new clear() method that allows the field to be emptied
	  correctly. Useful for a command line interface, for example
	  (hint, hint).
	  - Mouse and keyboard event handler methods would always return
	  false, which meant selecting with the mouse would also rotate the
	  trackball, and typing an 's' would turn on stats.
	  
	  [Code cleanup]
	  - Renamed the (local) _selectionMin and _selectionMax variables
	  which are used in a lot of places, as the underscores would lead
	  to think they were members. Either I called them
	  selection{Min|Max} or delete{Min|Max} where it made more sense.
	  - Fixed some indenting which was at 3 spaces (inconsistently),
	  I'm sure I didn't catch all the lines where this was the case
	  though.
	  - Put spaces between variable, operator and value where missing,
	  especially in for()s. Again I only did this where I made changes,
	  there are probably others left.
	  
	  The result is that delete, backspace, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, and
	  typing behaviour should now be consistent with text editor
	  conventions, whether insert mode is enabled or not. I hope. :-)
	  
	  Note, there's a nasty const_cast in there. Why isn't
	  osgText::Font::getGlyph() declared const?
	  
	  Also, as a note, the current implementation of cut, copy and
	  paste (in addition to being Windows only, yuck) gets and puts the
	  data into an std::string, thus if the osgText::String in the
	  field contains unicode characters I think it won't work
	  correctly. Perhaps someone could implement a proper clipboard
	  class that would be cross-platform and support osgText::String
	  (more precisely other languages like Chinese) correctly? Cut,
	  copy and paste are not critical to what I'm doing so I won't
	  invest the time to do that, but I just thought I'd mention it.

	* From Tassilo Glander, "I want to submit a fix for the plugin to
	  load .x model files (Direct X).
	  
	  The current version crashes when encountering global materials,
	  as also reported in the forum by the author of the plugin.
	  
	  The problem in mesh.cpp (app. ln 247) is, that references to
	  global materials that are given in curly brackets {} are not
	  supported by the reader. However, curly brackets seem to be
	  common, according to Bourke. Unfortunately, I found no
	  specification. However, also the DirectX model viewer that comes
	  with the DirectX-SDK (August 2009) expects curly brackets and
	  refuses models without them.
	  
	  My fix checks 2 more cases ("{ aMaterial }" -> 3 tokens and
	  "{aMaterial}" -> 1 token), and extracts the material name for the
	  lookup. I don't know if this is the most elegant solution, but
	  the tokenizer seems to split based on white spaces.
	  
	  You can reproduce the bug with the attached model (box.x), which
	  loads fine in other tools, such as 3DSmax, DeepExploration or the
	  DirectX model viewer. When I remove the curly brackets at the
	  reference of "myGlobalMaterial", it loads in osgviewer, but is
	  not standard conform.

	  This version of IntersectionVisitor.cpp is made against today's

	* From Brad Christiansen, "To build OSG using Visual Studio 2010
	  Terrain.cpp requires #include <iterator>. This is a very common
	  fix when using 2010 due to changes in Microsoft STL.
	  "

2010-07-31 09:21  robert

	* Fixed build

2010-07-31 09:04  robert

	* From Ryan Kawicki, "I found a memory leak within the Terrex
	  plugin.
	  
	  Out application has the ability to switch to different types of
	  terrains on the fly. This problem only exists in this type of
	  situation.
	  
	  The TXPArchive is held by the ReadWriterTXP class. When the
	  TXPNode, which is the top level node, is released from memory,
	  the archive associated to that TXPNode is also released. The
	  issue is that the reference count on the TXPArchive never gets to
	  zero.
	  
	  The reason why the reference count never gets to zero is because
	  the TXPParse, which is owned by the TXPArchive, stores a ref_ptr
	  to the TXPArchive. You can then see why this becomes a problem.
	  The TXPParser's ref_ptr cannot be unreferenced since the
	  TXPArchive has not released the TXPParser.
	  
	  Since the TXPParser is fully contained within the TXPArchive, I
	  don't see the reason to have the TXPParser have a ref_ptr to the
	  TXPArchive. I've made this change locally and have had no
	  problems and our memory leak has been fixed.

2010-07-31 09:03  robert

	* From Ryan Kawicki, fixed indentation

2010-07-31 08:57  robert

	* From Stephan Huber,
	  "changed the CmakeFiles for OpenThreads and the
	  osg-frameworks, so they are versioned by
	  OPENSCENEGRAPH_SOVERSION. "
	  
	  And from a later email:
	  
	  "Attached you'll find a fixed version of ModulInstall.cmake.
	  Hopefully it
	  works for old CMake-versions. I removed the offending line, and
	  the
	  compile went fine on my end."

2010-07-31 08:56  robert

	* Added output of triangles at problem vertices

2010-07-30 19:39  robert

	* Beginning of crease angle support for SmoothingVisitor to all it

	  thus enabling separate normals for triangles adjacent to the
	  creases.

2010-07-30 16:06  robert

	  FreeTypePlugin to aid development of new 3D text functionality.
	  
	  Added new test for original 3D text support and new experimental
	  code for exploring approaches to new 3D text support.

2010-07-12 11:30  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have now put together what I have for
	  the order independent transparency or
	  short oit. This rendering technique is also known as depth
	  peeling.
	  
	  Attached is the example that makes depth peeling work with the
	  fixed function
	  pipeline. Ok, this is 'old fashioned' but required for our use
	  case that
	  still has to work on older UNIX OpenGL implementations as well as
	  together
	  with a whole existing application making use of the fixed
	  function pipeline.
	  I can imagine to add support for shaders when we have that shader
	  composition
	  framework where we can add a second depth test in a generic way.
	  
	  This does *not* implement the dual depth peeling described in a
	  paper from the
	  ETH Zurich.
	  
	  This example could serve as a test case for the feature that you
	  can on the
	  fly remove pre render cameras that you made work a few time ago.
	  It is also a test case for the new TraversalOrderBin that is used
	  to composite
	  the depth layers in the correct blend order.
	  This example also stresses your new texture object cache since
	  you can change
	  some parameters for the oit implementation at runtime.
	  
	  You can just load any model with osgoit and see how it works.
	  Use the usual help key to see what you can change.
	  
	  There is already an osgdepthpeeling example that I could not
	  really make sense
	  of up to now. So I just made something new without touching what
	  I do not
	  understand."

2010-07-10 17:14  robert

	* Added debug State::print(std::ostream&) method and extra debug
	  messages in ShaderComposer and ShaderAttribute.
	  
	  Added better shader composition testing in the
	  osgshadercomposition example.

2010-07-10 10:07  robert

2010-07-08 10:56  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've found a minor bug in the cmake script of
	  src/osgPresentation when testing the osgIntrospection project. It
	  missed the Export header file and thus will not install this file

2010-07-08 10:51  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay and Martin Scheffler, "First are
	  Martin's changes:
	  * Added support for floating windows and context menus in
	  QMDIAreas.
	  * Protected the size (_width and _height) by a mutex to prevent
	  threading problems.
	  
	  Then my own:
	  * Made sure the embedded widget's size follows the graphicsView's
	  size at all times so that window resizes will resize the widget
	  as expected in fullscreen mode."

2010-07-07 11:02  robert

	* Added some debugging to investigate issue of global default
	  ShaderAttribute not being automatically assigned.

2010-07-06 12:19  robert

	* Added compile/release and resize of GL objects to
	  ShaderAttribute.

	* Added skipping of newlines in AsciiStreamOperator.h

2010-06-28 08:27  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "A solution for serialziers to call static
	  functions at the end of reading/writing is to use a user
	  serializer. The serialziers/osgManipulator/Draggers.cpp uses a
	  DefaultGeometry serializer to run setupDefaultGeometry() once the
	  reading process is finished, and this can also be applied to load
	  the TerrainTileCallback.
	  
	  I've attached the modified serializer/osgTerrain/TerrainTile.cpp
	  for tracing and solving current problem."

2010-06-28 08:24  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "The small change I have made (against
	  this morning's trunk) enables subclasses to register and
	  unregister windows via protected methods. I need this access as I
	  have a subclass that handles some of the oddities of mixing a
	  native OpenGL window with Java's windowing system. I doubt there
	  will be much general benefit of the modification but it should
	  also not be harmful in any way to others."

2010-06-28 08:20  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, "I have extended the attached zipped file
	  to recognize some more filenames and versions.
	  I added support to find libxml2 in the 3rdparty package if

	  "

2010-06-26 09:55  robert

	* Checked in missing source file.

2010-06-24 17:15  robert

	* Added beginnings of shader composition with the shells of the
	  ShaderComposer and ShaderAttribute classes. This aren't

	  osgIntrospection project that can be checked out thus:
	  
	  svn co http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/osgIntrospection
	  osgIntrospection

2010-06-21 16:48  robert

	* From Mathias Fiedler, "i'm using OSG on ES 2.0 and observed that
	  only one texture unit will be supported by OSG.
	  In State::initializeExtensionProcs() the _glMaxTextureUnits is
	  calculated based on osg::getGLVersionNumber().
	  At least for ES 2.0 this function will return 0.f since the
	  version string will look like "OpenGL ES 2.0 ...".
	  
	  My proposal doesn't touch getGLVersionNumber(), since desktop
	  OpenGL 2.0 isn't OpenGL ES 2.0.
	  So i changed the conditions in State::initializeExtensionProcs()
	  for getting the number via glGetIntegerv()."

2010-06-21 15:55  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "I have updated a bit the pkg-config system:
	  
	  1. Install the .pc file for osgIntrospection only if it is
	  compiled,
	  instead of unconditionally.
	  
	  2. New .pc file for osgQt, also created only if that library is
	  actually
	  compiled.

2010-06-18 15:48  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "While reading the code for
	  setUpViewFor3DSphericalDisplay I noticed that the top face of the
	  cube map uses Draw/Read buffer GL_BACK, while all other faces are
	  using the GL_FRONT buffer. This because the buffer variable is
	  hidden by a new buffer at lower scope.
	  Removing the local variable tested (win32 and linux64) and works
	  fine."

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I tried building the latest (as of
	  Sunday) SVN version of OSG using Visual Studio 2010 and it failed
	  due to a missing include. The build completed successfully by
	  adding #include <iterator> to nodeTrackerManipulator.cpp, which

2010-06-17 11:01  robert

	* From Jim Vaughan, "The attached file fixes a bug in the Inventor
	  loader that causes texture images to have r with a value of zero.
	  
	  The bug caused the image data to not get copied, size the size
	  was calculated to be zero. This caused crashes during rendering."

2010-06-16 16:49  robert

	* Fixed bug where PropertyAdjustmentCallback was being added
	  multiple times.

2010-06-16 15:56  robert

	* Changed the default behaviour of computeHomePosition so that it
	  uses the bounding sphere of the model rather than computing the
	  bounding box.

2010-06-16 15:56  robert

	  to return a valid bounding box.

2010-06-16 15:54  robert

2010-06-16 15:53  robert

	* Added reporting of possible deadlock of paging thread

2010-06-16 12:46  robert

	* Re-organized the access of the mutex in Terrain to avoid
	  deadlocks, and temporarily switched off the update of the
	  neightbouring tile boundaries within the
	  GeometryTechnique::generateGeometry method, again to avoid
	  deadlocks.

2010-06-16 08:13  robert

	* Added timing code for helping detect deadlocks in the paging
	  threads

2010-06-16 08:09  robert

	* Re-enabled call to ShareStateManager.

2010-06-15 13:57  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I've been working in the last few days
	  to get QWidgetImage to a point where it can fill a need we have:
	  to be
	  able to use Qt to make HUDs and to display widgets over / inside
	  an OSG
	  scene.
	  
	  ---------------
	  Current results
	  ---------------
	  I've attached what I have at this point. The modified
	  QWidgetImage +
	  QGraphicsViewAdapter classes can be rendered fullscreen (i.e. the
	  Qt
	  QGraphicsView's size follows the size of the OSG window) or on a
	  quad in
	  the scene as before. It will let events go through to OSG if no
	  widget
	  is under the mouse when they happen (useful when used as a HUD
	  with
	  transparent parts - a click-focus scheme could be added later
	  too). It
	  also supercedes Martin Scheffler's submission because it adds a
	  getter/setter for the QGraphicsViewAdapter's background color
	  (and the
	  user can set their widget to be transparent using
	  widget->setAttribute(Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground) themselves).
	  
	  The included osgQtBrowser example has been modified to serve as a
	  test
	  bed for these changes. It has lots more command line arguments
	  than
	  before, some of which can be removed eventually (once things are
	  tested). Note that it may be interesting to change its name or
	  split it
	  into two examples. Though if things go well, the specific
	  QWebViewImage
	  class can be removed completely and we can consolidate to using
	  QWidgetImage everywhere, and then a single example to demonstrate
	  it
	  would make more sense, albeit not named osgQtBrowser... You can
	  try this
	  path by using the --useWidgetImage --useBrowser command line
	  arguments -
	  this results in an equivalent setup to QWebViewImage, but using
	  QWidgetImage, and doesn't work completely yet for some unknown
	  reason,
	  see below.
	  
	  ----------------
	  Remaining issues
	  ----------------
	  There are a few issues left to fix, and for these I request the
	  community's assistance. They are not blockers for me, and with my
	  limited Qt experience I don't feel like I'm getting any closer to
	  fixing
	  them, so if someone else could pitch in and see what they can
	  find, it
	  would be appreciated. It would be really nice to get them fixed,
	  that
	  way we'd really have a first-class integration of Qt widgets in
	  an OSG
	  scene. The issues are noted in the osgQtBrowser.cpp source file,
	  but
	  here they are too:
	  
	  -------------------------------------------------------------------
	  QWidgetImage still has some issues, some examples are:
	  
	  1. Editing in the QTextEdit doesn't work. Also when started with
	  --useBrowser, editing in the search field on YouTube doesn't
	  work. But that same search field when using QWebViewImage
	  works... And editing in the text field in the pop-up getInteger
	  dialog works too. All these cases use QGraphicsViewAdapter
	  under the hood, so why do some work and others don't?
	  
	  a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen] (optional)
	  b) Try to click in the QTextEdit and type, or to select text
	  and drag-and-drop it somewhere else in the QTextEdit. These
	  don't work.
	  c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
	  d) Try the operations in b), they all work.
	  e) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --useBrowser [--fullscreen]
	  f) Try to click in the search field and type, it doesn't work.
	  g) osgQtBrowser
	  h) Try the operation in f), it works.
	  
	  2. Operations on floating windows (--numFloatingWindows 1 or
	  more).
	  Moving by dragging the titlebar, clicking the close button,
	  resizing them, none of these work. I wonder if it's because the
	  OS manages those functions (they're functions of the window
	  decorations) so we need to do something special for that? But
	  in --sanityCheck mode they work.
	  
	  a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --numFloatingWindows 1
	  [--fullscreen]
	  b) Try to drag the floating window, click the close button, or
	  drag its sides to resize it. None of these work.
	  c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --numFloatingWindows 1
	  --sanityCheck
	  d) Try the operations in b), all they work.
	  e) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen]
	  f) Click the button so that the getInteger() dialog is
	  displayed, then try to move that dialog or close it with the
	  close button, these don't work.
	  g) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
	  h) Try the operation in f), it works.
	  
	  3. (Minor) The QGraphicsView's scrollbars don't appear when
	  using QWidgetImage or QWebViewImage. QGraphicsView is a
	  QAbstractScrollArea and it should display scrollbars as soon as
	  the scene is too large to fit the view.
	  
	  a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --fullscreen
	  b) Resize the OSG window so it's smaller than the QTextEdit.
	  Scrollbars should appear but don't.
	  c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
	  d) Try the operation in b), scrollbars appear. Even if you have
	  floating windows (by clicking the button or by adding
	  --numFloatingWindows 1) and move them outside the view,
	  scrollbars appear too. You can't test that case in OSG for
	  now because of problem 2 above, but that's pretty cool.
	  
	  4. (Minor) In sanity check mode, the widget added to the
	  QGraphicsView is centered. With QGraphicsViewAdapter, it is not.
	  
	  a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen]
	  b) The QTextEdit and button are not in the center of the image
	  generated by the QGraphicsViewAdapter.
	  c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
	  d) The QTextEdit and button are in the center of the
	  QGraphicsView.
	  -------------------------------------------------------------------
	  
	  As you can see I've put specific repro steps there too, so it's
	  clear
	  what I mean by a given problem. The --sanityCheck mode is useful
	  to see
	  what should happen in a "normal" Qt app that demonstrates the
	  same
	  situation, so hopefully we can get to a point where it behaves
	  the same
	  with --sanityCheck and without."

2010-06-15 10:02  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "Here a fix about a leak in
	  InputStream::decompress
	  
	  I changed
	  _in->setStream( new std::stringstream(data) );
	  to
	  _dataDecompress = new std::stringstream(data);
	  _in->setStream( _dataDecompress );
	  
	  Then when the destructor is of InputStream is called I delete the
	  dataDecompress stringstream.

2010-06-15 09:14  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "Hi Bob, thanks for the CMake fixes. I'm
	  not sure what the purpose of the capitalisation changes was so
	  I've reverted that (a) to make diff-ing easier and (b) because
	  all-caps is consistent with all the other OSG CMake files. Aside
	  from that the changes seem fine.
	  I don't understand the changes to ReaderWriterFBX.cpp - (i)
	  strings.h isn't a standard header, (ii) the ISO-conformant form
	  is _strnicmp (with the underscore). Does the existing code not
	  compile for you? If not we'll have to do some #ifdef nastiness."

2010-06-15 09:09  mplatings

	* Changed _strnicmp to strncasecmp for non-Windows builds

2010-06-14 16:41  robert

	* From Tan Dunning and Jan Peciva, Jan's email : "I created a new
	  submission, based on Tan's two changes, including further naming
	  functionality that includes:
	  - geode and geometry naming
	  - shaders and osg::Program name
	  
	  as these nodes did not receive names before. Some code cleaning
	  included as well."

2010-06-14 16:30  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, added extra test case accessible via -t 7.

2010-06-14 16:27  robert

2010-06-14 15:58  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "while debugging a file loader I noticed a
	  missed check here."

2010-06-14 15:28  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Currently, if a GraphicsWindowWin32 is
	  created with traits->useCursor = false, it still shows the
	  cursor. An app must call gw->useCursor(false) after having
	  created the context as a workaround, but I think what we ask for
	  in the traits should be honored... Attached is a simple fix for
	  this.
	  
	  I have no idea when this stopped working. It worked before in our
	  2.6.0-based apps but after the upgrade to 2.8.3 it doesn't
	  anymore.
	  "

2010-06-14 15:25  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "For a long time, the osgviewerMFC example uses
	  addSlave() to setup the
	  graphics context and link it with a slave camera. I don't know
	  the
	  reason we perform like that, which will cause a problem that the
	  GUIEventHandler may not obtain correct window coordinates because
	  the
	  main camera will use a default input range to receive events from
	  the
	  slave camera's graphics context. It is also weird to see the
	  addSlave() used in non-cluster applications, which beginners will
	  be
	  confused with.
	  
	  I've make a slightly modification to the osgviewerMFC example to
	  make
	  it work without setting slave cameras. I've tested with the MDI
	  framework and everything seems fine."

2010-06-14 15:22  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "the IncrementalCompileOperation-class throws
	  away compiled compile-sets,
	  when no compileCompletedCallback is set. Attached you'll find a
	  simple
	  fix for this bug."

2010-06-14 15:21  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, change information about failed shader
	  compilation/linking/validation to OSG_WARN.

2010-06-14 15:20  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, additional comments, and standarisation of throw

	* Updated wrappers

2010-06-09 15:05  robert

	* Removed debug messages

2010-06-09 13:54  robert

	* Fixed reading of wrapped strings that contain multiple " within
	  the string

2010-06-09 13:09  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings, The attached file fixes 2 issues:
	  1) some time values were passed as floats, reducing accuracy.
	  2) comparisons done between doubles and floats gave different
	  results so time < endtime evaluated to false the first time it
	  was checked (with doubles), and true the second time it was
	  checked (with time having been converted to a float). This
	  consequently resulted in an array-out-of-bounds crash

2010-06-09 13:08  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings
	  I attach a simple fix that makes osgAnimation animations loop
	  correctly when their duration is different from the original
	  duration.

2010-06-09 11:24  robert

	* Added missing loadWrappers

2010-06-09 10:01  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Henry and Brendan just found a small bug of the
	  ListSerializer which
	  will cause the writing of osg::Switch incorrectly. The original
	  thread
	  was posted on osg-users. I would like to follow the suggestion of
	  Brendan and add a std::endl before the END_BRACKET in
	  ListSerializer::write().
	  "

2010-06-09 09:12  mplatings

	* From Alessandro Terenzi: previously the plugin ignored UV scaling
	  values eventually stored in the FBX file, now they are read and
	  set for each supported texture map (not considering reflection
	  maps).
	  
	  From Michael Platings: fixed UVs for files that don't explicitly
	  reference the name of a UV channel.

2010-06-08 17:32  mplatings

	* Added support for Euler angles and step/linear/cubic-bezier
	  interpolation.

	  and then removed correctly from the PagedLODLists.

2010-06-07 15:25  mplatings

	* Added more NURBS types to triangulate.

2010-06-07 11:28  robert

	* Added size() and swap() methods to provide a thread safe way to
	  keep track of size of a RequestQueue/ReadQueue.

2010-06-07 09:05  robert

	* Added removeNodes method to prune any nodes that are going to be
	  deleted from the PagedLODLists.

2010-06-07 08:36  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2010-06-04 19:50  mplatings

	* From Alessandro Terenzi: modifications for supporting opacity,
	  reflective and emissive maps beyond the already supported diffuse
	  map in the FBX plugin.
	  A problem with transparency has also been fixed: objects were
	  transparent wrt themselves but were opaque wrt to other objects.
	  Finally I added the support for "mixing factors" of diffuse,
	  reflective and opacity textures/values.
	  
	  From Michael Platings: added "LightmapTextures" plugin option
	  that changes the way textures are interpreted so Alessandro's
	  models appear correctly. Also refactored to put many functions in
	  one class to avoid passing around too many arguments to
	  functions.

2010-06-04 11:04  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2010-06-03 14:14  robert

	* Refactored the PagedLODList implementation so that it's now done
	  via a base class that enables different implementations to be
	  easily tried. Initial concrete PagedLODList is the
	  SetBasedPagedLODList.

2010-06-02 18:09  robert

	* Added #include <QtWebKit/QtWebKit>

2010-06-02 15:07  robert

	  ref_ptr<T>::ref_ptr(observer_ptr<T>&> constructor.

2010-06-01 18:20  robert

	* Changed types from unsigned int to int's to address warnings, and
	  changed the extension requirements so the GLES2 builds with FBO's
	  where supported

2010-06-01 15:20  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "MorphGeometry fix: this fixes a crash
	  found by Alessandro Terenzi"

2010-06-01 14:12  robert

	* From Frederic Bouvier, "here is my proposal. It is supposed to be
	  used like this :
	  
	  osg::Camera* c = createCamera();
	  c->attach( osg::Camera::COLOR_BUFFER0, texture3d, 0,
	  osg::Camera::FACE_CONTROLLED_BY_GEOMETRY_SHADER );
	  
	  it works also for cubemap textures and 2d texture arrays
	  "

2010-06-01 13:33  robert

	* From Michael Platings, introduced
	  osg::State::applyModelViewMaitrx(const osg::Matrix& matrix)
	  method and associated osg::State::_modelViewCache to enable
	  osgText::Text3D to be refactored in away that avoids
	  creating/destroying matrices

2010-06-01 13:32  robert

	* Added newline to fix warnings

2010-06-01 11:51  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "While tracking some valgrind problems in
	  flightgear, I found a remaining off by
	  one error in the rgb loader.
	  
	  Previously we limited the current line to the image with + 1.
	  With that change
	  it is correctly limited to the width of the image.
	  Also flightgear seems to run nice with that change.
	  "

2010-06-01 11:28  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "This is a patch that allows a ref_ptr to be
	  constructed using an observer_ptr argument, which is locked. This
	  is shorthand for declaring the ref_ptr and then passing it to
	  observer_ptr::lock().
	  
	  "

2010-06-01 11:23  robert

	* Removed unneccessary QWebKit includes

2010-06-01 09:23  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The Notify header doesn't include the OSG_ALWAYS
	  macro, which is used
	  in the quicktime plugin. The file attached is to fix that small
	  problem."

2010-06-01 09:21  robert

	* From Tim Moore, fixed typo and removed redundent include

2010-05-31 17:16  robert

2010-05-31 15:52  robert

	* From Xin Li, "use std::list::splice to replace std::list::insert
	  and std::list::clear
	  
	  it may use the constant time to move all the items in the
	  '_eventQueue' to 'events', and reduce the mutex holding time"

2010-05-25 15:52  robert

	* Removed export

2010-05-25 12:05  robert

	* From Jan Perciva with changes from Robert Osfield, "I am
	  submitting improved osgGA camera manipulators.
	  Changes:
	  - new mouse wheel zoom/movement/center functionality
	  - ability to fix vertical axis (important for CAD)
	  - possibility to specify values as absolute values or relative to
	  model size
	  - kind of backward compatibility by flags passed to constructor
	  - and much more
	  - restructuring classes to use kind of hierarchy and standard way
	  of event processing (handle methods). This way, there is much
	  more code reusability and it is more easy to develop new kinds of
	  manipulators.
	  
	  Briefly, the new architecture keeps MatrixManipulator as base
	  abstract class. StandardManipulator is the feature-rich standard
	  manipulator with two main descendant classes: OrbitManipulator
	  and FirstPersonManipulator. OrbitManipulator is base class for
	  all trackball style manipulators, based on center, rotation and
	  distance from center. FirstPersonManipulator is base for walk or
	  fly style manipulators, using position and rotation for camera
	  manipulation.
	  "
	  
	  Changes by Robert: Replaced osg::Vec3 by osg::Vec3d, introduced
	  DEFAULT_SETTINGS enum and usage. Added frame time member
	  variables in prep for improving throw animation when vysync is
	  off.

2010-05-24 14:16  robert

2010-05-24 09:44  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-05-22 15:45  robert

	* Refactored osgQt so that QWebViewImage is now entirely
	  implementated in the header, and osgQt itself no longer compiles
	  it,
	  leaving it to only applications that require it to include the
	  header and it's implementation and with ith the QWebKit
	  dependency.

2010-05-21 09:56  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Reading and Writing of

2010-05-21 09:34  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Support for compressed texture arrays
	  + mipmaps + auto mipmap generation. Changes vs OSG trunk. Thanks

	  few issues. This version was so well tested that it has to be

2010-05-13 11:01  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I modified some plugins to use the osgDB

2010-05-13 10:01  robert

	* From Gunter Huber, fixes for better GLES2 support

2010-05-12 20:02  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit my inbuilt schema data support
	  of
	  the OutputStream/InputStream implementations, which was just
	  finished
	  last weekend with a few tests on Windows and Ubuntu. Hope it
	  could
	  work and get more feedbacks soon.
	  
	  I've added a new option "SchemaData" to the osg2 plugin.
	  Developers
	  may test the new feature with the command line:
	  
	  # osgconv cow.osg cow.osgb -O SchemaData
	  
	  It will record all serializer properties used in the scene graph,
	  at
	  the beginning of the generated file. And when osgviewer and user
	  applications is going to read the osgb file, the inbuilt data
	  will be
	  automatically read and applied first, to keep backwards
	  compatibility
	  partly. This will not affect osgb files generated with older
	  versions.

2010-05-12 15:11  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, fixed memory leak when using
	  OpenThread::Mutex based reference counting.

2010-05-12 14:34  robert

	* Removed inappropriate code which was causing a memory leak. This

2010-05-12 08:54  mplatings

	* From Martins Innus: The current fbx writer doesn't seem to
	  support BIND_PER_VERTEX for normals. If you have this type of
	  geometry it, exports the the first normal in the array over the
	  whole primitive set. I don't know that the attached change should
	  be applied as is, since I don't know enough about DrawArrays and
	  Draw Elements to know if the indices for the vertices and normals
	  are guaranteed to be the same. I tried it on a couple models and
	  that seemed to be the case. The alternative is to have the logic
	  down in setControlPointAndNormalsAndUV and set the normals there
	  with the "vertexIndex" if the binding type is per vertex. Not
	  sure what is cleaner.

2010-05-11 17:02  mplatings

	* From Martins Innus: allow the fbx exporter to reference textures
	  correctly if the stateset is applied to the Geode instead of
	  Geometry

2010-05-11 09:08  mplatings

	* Fix from Martins Innus for error: extra qualification

2010-04-30 20:04  robert

	* updated wrappers

2010-04-30 19:42  robert

	* Added support for stripping all by text nodes from a p3d xml
	  file, and merging of an original and stripped p3d xml file for
	  the purpose of using external editors to fix spelling mistakes

2010-04-30 19:41  robert

	* Added proper support for writing out Xml graph

2010-04-30 19:41  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-04-30 15:51  robert

	* Added beginnings of spell checking support

2010-04-30 12:22  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've just made another OSG+Qt (GUI) examples to
	  demonstrate how to create OSG views, add them to a
	  CompositeViewer, and add corresponding widgets to Qt layouts or
	  as popup windows. The example inherits a GraphicsWindowQt from
	  the GraphicsWindow base class and implements most of the virtual
	  methods. A QGLWidget is created at the same time to perform
	  keyboards and mouse events, who is also added as the main
	  widget's child.
	  
	  The new example, named osgviewerQtContext (because of deriving
	  from GraphicsContext), works fine on Windows XP SP3 and Qt 4.5.0,
	  with 4 widgets in QGridLayout and a popup window and 60Hz frame
	  rate. I haven't tested it on Unix/Linux and Mac OSX yet. So any
	  feedback from these platforms is appreciated. I wish this example
	  be a useful complement to current osgviewerQt and
	  osgviewerQtWidgets ones. :)
	  
	  Some unfinished functionalities: inheritedWindowData,
	  sharedContext, and more tests needed."

2010-04-30 11:48  robert

	* Changed DisplaySetting::instance() to return a ref_ptr<>& rathern
	  than a raw C pointer to enable apps to delete the singleton or
	  assign their own.

2010-04-30 10:52  robert

	* Added free of _visualInfo if it's already been allocated

2010-04-30 10:51  robert

	* Changed debug messages to use printf to avoid issues with using
	  notify at startup and exit.

2010-04-30 10:50  robert

	* Added support for using dot graphs directly in the
	  <graph></graph> token

2010-04-29 15:23  robert

	* From Bernardt Duvenhage: "I noticed that in
	  'src/OpenThreads/pthreads/CMakeLists.txt' a '!' has been written
	  instead of 'NOT' within an if statement expression.
	  
	  IF(!OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS) ...
	  vs.
	  IF(NOT OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS) ...
	  
	  This has the effect of always compiling OpenThreads as a
	  framework under OSX. The CMakeLists.txt that I use to be able to
	  compile the non-framework version of OpenThreads is attached. I
	  simply replaced the '!' replaced by a 'NOT' and added a MESSAGE
	  to notify me when the .framework will be compiled."

2010-04-29 11:59  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "I've updated the FBX plugin to use the
	  latest version of the FBX SDK. I've checked in the plugin files
	  myself, but I need you to check in this change to FindFBX.cmake
	  to change the SDK directory."

2010-04-29 09:46  robert

	* Fixed handling of Terrain/CoordinateSystem node so that the code
	  now handles the fact that Terrain now subclasses from
	  CoordinateSystemNode.

2010-04-28 22:08  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-04-28 21:22  robert

	* From Alok Priyadarshi, "1. Replaced APIENTRY to GL_APIENTRY which
	  is used by OpenGL ES
	  headers. For desktop GL GL_APIENTRY has been defined as
	  APIENTRY."

2010-04-28 21:10  robert

	* Fixed typo

2010-04-28 20:33  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Two small bugs were just found when I was writing
	  examples for my book
	  in process: a wrong definition of the OSG_FATAL macro, and wrong
	  logic
	  inside the KeySwitchMatrixManipulator::getDistance() function. I
	  believe both were slips."

2010-04-28 20:21  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "There's a subtle bug in
	  osgDB::getFileExtension where it returns an incorrect value if
	  the filename does not contain an extension but a sub-directory
	  contains a dot character. I've modified the function so that it
	  checks for this case."

2010-04-28 20:16  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The osgManipulator serializers are ready now. I
	  need to modify the
	  META_OSGMANIPULATOR_Object macro to ensure these classes could
	  work
	  with their wrappers, and a few naming styles should be changed as
	  well. Fortunately everything seems to compile fine under Windows
	  and
	  my new Ubuntu system.
	  
	  And I finally find the problem of the
	  serializers/osgTerrain/Terrain.cpp, it just missed an
	  "osg::Group"
	  before "osg::CoordinateSystemNode" indicator. With the small fix
	  attached now VPB could generate terrain with osgt/osgb formats."

2010-04-28 20:10  robert

	* From John Ivar Haugland and Michael Platings,
	  JIV:"I deleted a line from the ReaderWriterDAE.cpp file that was
	  introduced in rev 11341. I got a crash on this line when the
	  options pointer was NULL."
	  MP:"Good spot John. The next line is also unnecessary and can be
	  removed as well (attached, plus some minor code beautifying)"

2010-04-28 18:53  robert

	* Added support for passing options to the .dot plugin

2010-04-28 18:52  robert

	* Added support for passing in an options string to control the
	  orientation of the generated graph

2010-04-28 17:29  robert

	* Introduced the use of ref_ptr<> in read show methods

2010-04-28 17:18  robert

	* Removed redundent files

2010-04-28 14:56  robert

	* Added support for using graphviz dot for graphics visualization
	  via <graph>filename</graph> token.

2010-04-28 14:55  robert

	* Fixed typo

2010-04-28 14:55  robert

	* Added colours and different style to drawable and statesets

2010-04-28 14:05  mplatings

	* No longer removes redundant nodes because node structure may be
	  important.

2010-04-28 10:15  robert

	* Replaced afprintf usage with std::string to fix memory leak and
	  improve portability of code.

2010-04-26 10:07  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated xcode-project

2010-04-23 16:35  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk and Robert Osfield, improvements to the
	  indentation of comments.

2010-04-23 09:29  robert

	* From Hatwig Wiesmann, "osg::TransferFunction1D::assignToImage may
	  assign NaN values to the image in case an underflow inside the
	  method occurs. This underflow can be reproduced by the following
	  call sequence:
	  
	  osg::TransferFunction1D* tf(new osg::TransferFunction1D());
	  
	  tf->allocate(18);
	  tf->setColor(-10000,osg::Vec4( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0,1.0));
	  tf->setColor(-1e-6,osg::Vec4( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0,1.0));
	  tf->setColor( 0,osg::Vec4( 0.0, 0.0, 1.0,1.0));
	  
	  Remark: The value -1e-6 may be added (falsely) because of a
	  rounding error.
	  
	  The attached fix prevents assigning NaN values to the image.
	  "

2010-04-23 08:58  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-04-23 08:55  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "This submissions fixes the problem of
	  the difference of std::*::size_type between 32bit and 64 bit
	  platforms. It wraps the reading and writing of std::*::size_type
	  values using the osgDB::InputStream::readSize and
	  osgDB::OutputStream::writeSize methods."

2010-04-22 17:02  robert

	* From Marcin Hajder, "This submission contains
	  Texture2DMultisample osg implementation.
	  
	  Texture2DMultismaple as name suggests provides means to directly
	  access subsamples of rendered FBO target. (GLSL 1.5 texelFetch
	  call).
	  
	  Recently I was working on deferred renderer with OSG, during that
	  I noticed there is no support for multisampled textures
	  (GL_ARB_texture_multisample extension). After consultations with
	  Paul Martz and Wojtek Lewandowski I added Texture2DMultisample
	  class and made few necessary changes around
	  osg::FrameBufferObject, osg::Texture and osgUtil::RenderStage
	  classes."
	  
	  and from follow email:
	  
	  "Fixed. According to ARB_texture_multisample extension
	  specification multisample textures don't need TexParameters since
	  they can only be fetched with texelFetch."

2010-04-22 16:08  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached a small fix so that
	  osgDB::convertStringFromUTF8toCurrentCodePage actually performs
	  the conversion onto the destination string."

2010-04-22 16:01  robert

	* From Alok Priyadashi, "The attached patch fixes
	  - compile errors on windows when compiled with UNICODE flag
	  - warnings for duplicate WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN. I think this should
	  better fixed by adding WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN to vcproj preprocessor
	  list."

2010-04-22 13:07  robert

	* From John Ivar Haugland, "I have added the serializer for
	  UserData in osg::Object. See the attached modified file:
	  src\osgWrappers\serializers\osg\Object.cpp"

2010-04-22 11:20  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog, and AUTHORS files

2010-04-22 10:13  robert

	* From Tim Moore, added check to whether validConfigs is empty.

2010-04-22 08:59  robert

	* Added a temporary /* */ around the check against _traits->vsync
	  to avoid the errors reported with the current usage of
	  RestoreContext for setting the vsync.

2010-04-22 07:32  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, fixed typo

2010-04-21 17:16  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlien with little bits from Robert Osfield and
	  Chris Hanson, added provisionl support for controlling sync to
	  vblank.

2010-04-21 16:44  robert

	* Changed "Sorted" label to "Sorted Drawables"

2010-04-21 16:37  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "When compiling the example on VS9, the
	  compiler complain about undefined GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32F and
	  GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32F_NV. So I added them to
	  include/osg/FrameBufferObject. The example builds fine and is
	  working for me without crashs unless it is ran whithout argument.
	  I added couple of lines to check for arguments number and print
	  the example usage when needed."

2010-04-20 16:27  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The OSG book I'm working on will focus on helping
	  beginners build
	  latest OSG source code with Visual Studio 2010 express, without
	  setting too many options and without facing unexpected errors.
	  But at
	  present, the compilation process will fail because the INSTALL
	  project
	  'cannot find' generated DLLs while copying files. I have looked
	  into
	  the build directory and found that the places of generated file
	  folders were just different from previous VS versions. In this
	  case,
	  the old hack in OsgMacroUtils.cmake may become invalid:
	  
	  MACRO(HANDLE_MSVC_DLL)
	  #this is a hack... the build place is set to lib/<debug or
	  release> by LIBARARY_OUTPUT_PATH equal to OUTPUT_LIBDIR
	  #the .lib will be crated in ../ so going straight in lib by
	  the IMPORT_PREFIX property
	  #because we want dll placed in OUTPUT_BINDIR ie the bin folder
	  sibling of lib, we can use ../../bin to go there,
	  ...
	  ELSE(NOT MSVC_IDE)
	  SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES PREFIX
	  "../../bin/${LIB_PREFIX}${LIB_SOVERSION}-" IMPORT_PREFIX "../")
	  ENDIF(NOT MSVC_IDE)
	  ENDMACRO(HANDLE_MSVC_DLL)
	  
	  Here the prefix "../../bin" may need to be fixed. I just modified
	  it to:
	  
	  IF(MSVC_VERSION LESS 1600)
	  SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES PREFIX
	  "../../bin/${LIB_PREFIX}${LIB_SOVERSION}-" IMPORT_PREFIX "../")
	  ENDIF()
	  
	  It should keep compatible with old MSVC versions. There are
	  similar
	  fixes in the SETUP_PLUGIN and SETUP_EXE macros. I haven't tested
	  them
	  on more platforms.
	  "

2010-04-20 13:52  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Currently if multiple event callbacks are
	  nested on one node, only the first will be called. The proposed
	  fix checks if there is a nested callback."

2010-04-20 13:34  robert

	* Implemented Colin MacDonald's recommended change of "unsigned
	  short" to "unsigned" to solve big endian problem under Solaris.
	  Also added comment to highlight the oddity of the mixing of types
	  in the associated lib3ds code.

2010-04-20 11:38  robert

	* Replaced tabs with four spaces

2010-04-20 11:34  robert

	* UPdated wrappers

2010-04-20 11:23  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a fix to the curl plugin CMake to
	  allow it to link against the
	  CURL_LIBRARY_DEBUG and ZLIB_LIBRARY_DEBUG. Previously it linked
	  the
	  debug version against the release libs, which was causing a hang
	  when
	  running in debug mode on Windows."

2010-04-20 11:13  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Anaglyphic stereo does not seem to work
	  properly when performing pre-render stages. I believe the reason
	  is that the pre-render stages are performed with the last applied
	  color mask, which is cyan. I've fixed this by resetting the color
	  mask before performing the pre-render stages."

2010-04-20 11:05  robert

	* Fixed the background quad size to fit all the camera stats labels

2010-04-20 10:59  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "I noticed that the "Materials" statistic in the
	  camera scene stats display seemed to be identical to the number
	  of drawables. In fact, it displays the nummat member of
	  osgUtil::Statistics, but that variable has nothing to do with
	  materials. nummat tracks the number of matrices associated with
	  Drawable objects in a RenderBin; as I understand it, Drawables
	  pretty much always have a model-view matrix tied to them in
	  RenderBins, so this statistic doesn't seem very useful. So, I
	  added statistics for the number of StateGraph objects in
	  RenderBins and also for the number of Drawables in the "fine
	  grain ordering" of RenderBins. The latter corresponds to the
	  number of Drawables in the scene that are sorted by some criteria
	  other than graphics state; usually that is distance for
	  semi-transparent objects, though it could be traversal order.
	  These two statistics give an idea of the number of graphic state
	  changes happening in a visible scene: each StateGraph implies a
	  state change, and there could be a change for each sorted object
	  too. You can also subtract the number of sorted Drawables from
	  the total number of Drawables and get an idea of how many
	  Drawables are being drawn for each StateGraph.
	  "

2010-04-20 10:35  robert

	* Changed the AbmientBias type from Vec2d to Vec2 as use of double
	  is inappropriate.

2010-04-20 10:29  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "The new osgShadow and osgFX serializers are
	  attached, and some
	  modifications of the osgShadow header naming styles as well. The
	  osgDB::Serializer header is also changed to add new Vec2
	  serializer
	  macros because of the needs of osgShadow classes. It should
	  compile
	  fine on both Windows and Linux. But I have only done a few tests
	  to
	  generate .osgb, .osgt and .osgx formats with these new wrappers."

2010-04-20 09:48  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "This submission fixes
	  osgDAE::toString(*) unresolved external symbols compile errors
	  (on VS)."

2010-04-19 14:49  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that
	  osg::State::getInitialViewMatrix returns the monocular view
	  matrix when rendering in stereo. I've made some changes to
	  osgUtil::RenderStage & SceneView so that it will return the
	  correct view matrix depending on which eye is currently being
	  rendered." & "I made a small change to the previous patch so that
	  osg::State::getInitialViewMatrix works correctly with pre/post
	  render stages as well."

2010-04-19 13:44  robert

	* From Stephan Huber and Mathieu Marache, "attached you'll find
	  framework support for os x via cmake. Please credit
	  Mathieu Marache, he added the last missing piece to this puzzle.
	  
	  I think it is safe to commit these changes to trunk, as the
	  traditional
	  way via dylibs should work as before.
	  
	  Here's some more info how to get frameworks:
	  
	  With these modifications it is possible to compile frameworks on
	  OS X,
	  when you set the Cmake-option OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS to true. If
	  you
	  want to embed the frameworks in your app-bundle make sure to set
	  OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS_INSTALL_NAME_DIR accordingly.
	  
	  You'll have to build the install-target of the generated
	  xcode-projects
	  as this sets the install_name_dirs of the frameworks and
	  plugins."

2010-04-19 12:09  robert

	* From Martins Innus,"Here's a fix to allow the serializer to
	  compile on the Mac 10.4 SDK. The definition of GLint seems to be
	  different accross the SDKs. Its defined as "long" in 10.4. I have
	  no idea if this is the correct way to go about this, but it
	  compiles on my end."

2010-04-19 11:43  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "This contains a couple of fixes to support
	  changing FrameBufferObject configurations on the fly; the user
	  changes the camera attachments and calls
	  Renderer::setCameraRequiresSetUp(). The major part of this
	  submission is a comprehensive example of setting up floating
	  point depth buffers. The user can change the near plane value and
	  cycle through the available combinations of depth format and
	  multisample buffer formats."

2010-04-19 10:35  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attached is the osgAnimation wrappers for
	  serialize IO operations. A
	  few headers and the osgAnimation sources are also modified to
	  make
	  everything goes well, including:
	  
	  A new REGISTER_OBJECT_WRAPPER2 macro to wrap classes like
	  Skeleton::UpdateSkeleton.
	  A bug fix in the Seralizer header which avoids setting default
	  values
	  to objects.
	  Naming style fixes in osgAnimation headers and sources, also in
	  the
	  deprecated dotosg wrappers.
	  A bug fix for the XML support, to write char values correctly.
	  A small change in the osg::Geometry wrapper to ignore the
	  InternalGeometry property, which is used by the MorphGeometry and
	  should not be set by user applications.
	  
	  The avatar.osg, nathan.osg and robot.osg data files all work fine
	  with
	  serializers, with some 'unsupported wrapper' warnings when
	  converting.
	  I'm thinking of removing these warnings by disabling related
	  property
	  serializers (ComputeBoundingBoxCallback and
	  Drawable::UpdateCallback),
	  which are seldom recorded by users.
	  
	  By the way, I still wonder how would we handle the C4121 problem,
	  discussed some days before. The /Zp compile option is set to 16
	  in the
	  attached cmake script file. And is there a better solution now?"

2010-04-15 18:40  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The new 3ds plugin isn't working at all on
	  big-endian machines, due to
	  a byte order issue.
	  
	  The problem is that osg::SwapBytes code has been copied from the
	  old
	  plugin to the new one, but the latest lib3ds also incorporates
	  code to
	  handle byte ordering in read & writing. So the net result is that
	  the
	  swap is done twice.
	  
	  The solution is simply to remove the custom osg code, and use the
	  stock lib3ds code. The attached files are against today's
	  revision
	  11331. I've tested on Sparc & Intel.

2010-04-15 11:49  robert

	* From Sukender, "After discussion with Paul Martz, here is a fix
	  for 3DS reader/writer (on rev. 11315) + some changes. Changelog:
	  
	  - Fixed handling of MatrixTransforms (still doesn't support other
	  Transforms types). Fixes things for OSG, DeepExploration,
	  3DSMax...
	  - Added support for writing double precision vertices by
	  converting them.
	  - Added base code for future compatibility option (3rd-party apps
	  that don't read animation data). See "DISABLE_3DS_ANIMATION"
	  compile flag."

2010-04-15 11:45  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a small fix to the DatabasePager to
	  fix a crash if you were
	  running with the OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL set to INFO.
	  
	  An iterator was being erased, and then referenced to display a
	  message. Just changed it to display the message first, then
	  erase."

2010-04-15 11:41  robert

2010-04-15 11:40  robert

	* Changed std::pair declaration to ListTriangle::value_type to
	  avoid Solaris compile errors

2010-04-15 11:02  robert

	* Removed the setting of the DatabasePager thread affinity, and
	  moved the setting of the DatabasePager thread priotity to after
	  the creation of the threads

2010-04-14 16:43  mplatings

	* Updated the plugin to be compatible with version 2011.2 of the
	  FBX SDK

2010-04-14 13:39  robert

	* Added minimum frame delay of 1/100th second when using

2010-04-14 10:43  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-04-13 18:42  robert

	  that an image has been modified.

2010-04-13 14:50  mplatings

	* Added support for double precision geometry

2010-04-13 13:06  robert

	* From Michael Platings with tweaks from Robert Osfield, added
	  Options::s/getPrecisionHint(..) to allow apps to hint to plugins

	* From Sukender: Fixed FBX writer: now handles double precision
	  arrays (vertices, normals, texcoords)

2010-04-09 08:52  robert

	* Added corner dirty options to TerrainTechnique, added
	  experimental code paths in GeometryTechnique for accounting for
	  neighbouring corner tiles - optionally compiled out in this
	  check-in.
	  
	  Changed the normal computation in GeometryTechnique so that it
	  doesn't include diagonals, thus avoid normal jumps at corners.

2010-04-03 16:26  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-04-03 16:21  robert

	* Change Terrain so that it subclassed from CoordinateSystemNode.
	  
	  Implemented new update scheme of GeometryTechnique to avoid
	  potential threading issues.
	  
	  Added Terrain support to .ive.

2010-04-01 21:18  robert

	* Removed getNeighbours() method to avoid problems with

2010-04-01 21:04  robert

	* Added window size event handler

2010-03-29 08:49  robert

	* Added TerainHandler event handler to provide 'v'/'V' and 'r'/'R'
	  key controls for change vertical scale and sample ratio
	  respectively.

2010-03-26 11:09  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When the StatsHandler tries to find a
	  context to add itself to, it will first look for a
	  GraphicsWindow, and if none is found it will look for a
	  GraphicsContext. This enables apps that do all their rendering to
	  offscreen contexts (pbuffer) to still use the StatsHandler."

2010-03-26 11:07  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-03-26 09:01  robert

2010-03-25 17:50  cedricpinson

	* Change time type from float to double in osgAnimation

2010-03-25 14:19  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I added some features to the vrml
	  plugin.
	  
	  The plugin can now handle embeded PixelTexture fields in addition
	  to the
	  already implemented ImageTexture fields.
	  
	  Fixed a bug with texture repeat being applied to the wrong
	  texture dimension.
	  
	  Added handling for IndexedLineSet geometries."

2010-03-25 14:14  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a small enhancement for
	  GraphicsWindowCocoa. My
	  submision adds a getter for the pixel-format. I need this for
	  some
	  custom software so I can integrate CoreVideo-playback with osg.
	  "

2010-03-25 14:12  robert

	* Fixed warning

2010-03-25 11:11  robert

	* Introduced the use of linear interpolation of evelvations when
	  sampling

2010-03-24 17:12  robert

	* Added a compile test for pthread_setaffinity_np to workaround
	  problem with the FreeBSD pthread lib containing the function but
	  the pthread.h header not containing it.

2010-03-24 14:27  robert

	* Refactored the way that the RequestQueue's are pruned and highest
	  prioty items taken from them so the operation is
	  now O(n) rather than O(nlogn) where n is the number of requests.
	  The refactoring also cleans up the access of the
	  request lists so that the code is more readable/maintainable.

2010-03-23 12:41  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-03-22 17:55  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "the attached files fix the DAE importer
	  for animations that don't contain channels for all X, Y and Z
	  components, as exported by SoftImage."

2010-03-22 14:32  robert

	* Changed private: to protected: to fix build issue under OSX

2010-03-22 13:13  robert

	* From Chuck Seberino, "have a fix for the reading code in
	  trunk/src/osgPlugins/gz/ReaderWriterGZ.cpp. It seems that the
	  std::istream::readsome method on windows is a no-op (for files.
	  After much head scratching and research I was able to figure out
	  what was going on. I am submitting a fix to replace readsome with
	  read() and gcount(). This change is for all platforms. The
	  previous implementation works fine under linux and OSX, so if you
	  would rather keep things the way they are you can just #ifdef for
	  non-WIN32.
	  
	  I also added openmode flags to the ifstream constructor, since
	  they were needed to get proper reading as well as a typo fix."

2010-03-22 12:50  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that osg::notify does not
	  output to stderr when using either FATAL or WARN severity levels.
	  There is code in osg::StandardNotifyHandler::notify that will use
	  stderr based on the severity level, but it is disabled by an #if
	  0. I'm assuming this was a mistake and have re-enabled the code.
	  
	  Many IDEs will capture the output of processes and highlight
	  stderr messages in red. After upgrading from OSG 1.2, I was
	  noticing that none of the error messages were being highlighted,
	  which I find quite useful."

2010-03-22 10:43  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated xcode-project

2010-03-20 09:45  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, changed init() call to _init().

2010-03-19 20:12  mplatings

	* Workaround for files exported from SoftImage that don't tag
	  skeleton nodes correctly.

2010-03-19 18:28  mplatings

	* From Paul Martz: This is a fix to get the FBX plugin to compile
	  on OS X

2010-03-19 17:09  robert

	* Added a minimum tiles size of 16 to prevent down sampling from
	  being overly aggressive.

2010-03-19 16:31  robert

	* Added new osgterrain example that is simplified to just basic
	  setup and control osgTerrain nodes, leaving the
	  osgthreadedterrain as the more complex example.

2010-03-19 16:30  robert

	* Renamed source file

2010-03-19 14:55  robert

	* Renamed osgterrain to osgthreadedterrain to better reflect it's
	  functionality.

2010-03-19 10:19  mplatings

	* Fixed an infinite loop when loading a malformed file.

2010-03-18 19:02  mplatings

	* Workaround for models with inverted transparency

2010-03-18 17:10  robert

	* Added StateSet event handler to osgfont and osgtext to aid with
	  debugging

2010-03-18 15:04  robert

	* Added in a test of using the utility classes in
	  include/osgUtil/MeshOptimizers to see if they could improve
	  peformance.
	  
	  Tests shown poorer performance with the code enabled so for now
	  the code is #if 0 #endif'd out, and just left in place for future
	  testing.

2010-03-18 14:41  robert

	* Removed the sizeAdjustment code as it was leading to incorrect
	  tex coord generation and clipping of the left handside
	  of the text glyphs.

2010-03-17 14:36  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, "attached an updated FindGDAL that finds 1.6.0
	  version in Debian unstable. Could also be added to VPB.
	  
	  Also some misc spelling fixes in CMakeLists.txt"

2010-03-17 14:32  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "The PLY plugin only works for a file that
	  includes both vertices and faces. This patch adds support for PLY
	  files that include only vertices (a point cloud)."

2010-03-17 11:35  robert

	* disabled timing debug info

2010-03-17 10:33  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2010-03-16 18:53  robert

2010-03-16 18:43  robert

	* Added BlendingPolicy support into osgTerrain::Terrain.

2010-03-16 12:05  robert

	* Added
	  osgTerrain::TerrainTile::set/getBlendingPolicy(BlendingPolicy) to
	  enable control over whether the tile should have blending enabled
	  on it.

2010-03-15 20:09  robert

	* Fixed recursive call due to missing _

2010-03-15 15:10  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "This small one-line change allows us
	  to load a geometry shader with the extension .geom with
	  osgDB::readShaderFile() which will return an osg::Shader* with
	  the type already set to GEOMETRY. Very convenient. :-)
	  
	  This was already possible for .frag and .vert so there's no
	  reason why it shouldn't be possible for .geom.
	  
	  I also changed the alignment of some extension aliases so the
	  file looks a bit better now, but it's up to you if you want to
	  merge that or not.
	  "

2010-03-15 15:01  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that CMake forces a high stack
	  size by default for all MSVC projects. This can cause problems
	  for applications that use a lot of threads. I've added a new
	  option MSVC_USE_DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE that will remove the explicit
	  stack size and use the default MSVC size. Apparently this was
	  only necessary for very old versions of MSVC but it's still
	  around. I would argue that this option should be on by default,
	  but I've left it off for now.
	  
	  "

2010-03-15 14:47  robert

	* From Wang Rui,
	  "Here is a small fix in the eventTraversal() function of both
	  viewer
	  and composite viewer class.
	  
	  if (getCameraWithFocus())
	  {
	  if (getCameraWithFocus()!=getCamera()) // Newly added
	  {
	  osg::Viewport* viewport = getCameraWithFocus()->getViewport();
	  osg::Matrix localCameraVPW =

	  x = new_coord.x();
	  y = new_coord.y();
	  }
	  ...
	  }
	  
	  I put an additional conditional statement here to ensure that
	  _cameraWithCamera and _camera are different, otherwise it's no
	  need to
	  calculate the transition matrix from main camera to focus camera.
	  The
	  excess calculations of 'matrix' and 'new_coord' may cause
	  floating-point error and return a slightly wrong result other
	  than an
	  identity matrix. It seems OK in most cases but will be still pain
	  when
	  there is little difference between two mouse moving events. "

2010-03-15 10:32  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-03-15 10:32  robert

	* Refactored Texture::Extensions to simplify it and make it more
	  efficient.

2010-03-14 08:56  robert

	* Added return into ReaderWriterOSG2::prepareReading(..) to prevent
	  bug associated with result being discarded.

2010-03-13 11:28  robert

	* Refactored the initialization of OSX windowing settings so that
	  it's done on demand rather than on startup.

2010-03-12 09:32  robert

	* Added initializer

2010-03-12 09:10  robert

	* Changed ssize_t to int to fix windows build error

2010-03-11 18:15  robert

	* From Time Moore, "This submission implements 3 optimizations for
	  meshes. INDEX_MESH turns DrawArrays style geometry into
	  DrawElements, uniquifying the vertices in the process. This is
	  useful for certain loaders, like ac3d, which just spit out
	  DrawArrays. VERTEX_POSTTRANSFORM and VERTEX_PRETRANSFORM optimize
	  mesh triangle and vertex order for the caches on a modern GPU,
	  using Tom Forsyth's algorithm. I describe this and the big
	  difference it makes (38% improvement on a very large mesh) in my
	  blog,
	  http://shiny-dynamics.blogspot.com/2010/03/vertex-cache-optimization-for-osg.html."

2010-03-11 16:53  robert

	* From Sukender, "I had some conflicts when updating but they seem
	  resolved now. Attached files (four files) are against rev. 11200.
	  Changelog:
	  - Replaced exceptions with assert() or OSG_NOTIFY
	  - Replaced osg::notify() with OSG_NOTIFY
	  - Changed braces and tabs to fit OSG coding convention
	  - Cleaned a few things in code (names, added deallocations upon
	  error)"

2010-03-11 16:46  robert

	* Clean up of initialization of statics/use of getenv

2010-03-11 14:48  robert

	* Added export for PerContextShader.

2010-03-11 10:24  robert

	* Cleaned up the registration of wrappers so that they are done on
	  demand.

2010-03-11 10:17  robert

	* Fixed warning

2010-03-10 17:23  robert

	* From David Fries,"This improves the out of box detection of the
	  3rd party libraries for
	  Windows. If the 3rdparty directory isn't available it will use
	  the
	  directory names subversion uses such as
	  3rdParty_win32binaries_vs71
	  3rdParty_win32binaries_vs80sp1 3rdParty_win32binaries_vs90sp1.
	  That
	  helps when as we are building both vs71 and vs80, and probably
	  vs90 in
	  the future at the same time in addition to not having to rename
	  the
	  directory once it is downloaded. It also adds the _i suffix to
	  match
	  some of the libraries.
	  "

2010-03-10 17:19  robert

	* From David Fries,"We are needing to compile Debug, Release, and
	  MinSizeWithDebInfo, but
	  currently only Debug appends "d" so the Release and
	  MinSizeWithDebInfo
	  (and MinSizeRel) all produce the same filenames. This set of
	  changes
	  lets each build type have a cmake defined string appended,
	  defaulting
	  to Release none, Debug d, RelWithDebInfo rd, MinSizeRel s. But a
	  user
	  still can have Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel to produce
	  the
	  same filenames. It does so by setting the preprocessor define
	  OSG_LIBRARY_POSTFIX in src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt to one of the
	  previously defined cmake variables CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
	  CMAKE_RELEASE_POSTFIX CMAKE_RELWITHDEBINFO_POSTFIX
	  CMAKE_MINSIZEREL_POSTFIX. This method cuts down on the #ifdef
	  _DEBUG
	  #else preprocessor directives in Registry.cpp as the extension is
	  always passed in OSG_LIBRARY_POSTFIX. That and __MINGW32__ didn't
	  have the _DEBUG check which looks like a bug."

2010-03-10 16:31  robert

	* From Roger James, "Here is a small stability fix to the dae
	  reader which seems to have dropped out of the latest version."

2010-03-10 16:31  robert

	* Updated version

2010-03-10 16:05  robert

	* From Sukender, "I've fixed positions for 3DS writer. Points in
	  3DS must be in world coordinates and I added what was missing.
	  And by refactoring a bit of code, I may have fixed some StateSets
	  related bugs (was ignoring StateSets for osg::Groups).
	  I also added support for Billboard's points, so now "osgconv
	  lz.osg lz.3ds" has an acceptable output. However, there is no
	  rotation depending on billboards' axis, hence the notice
	  "Warning: 3DS writer is incomplete for Billboards (rotation not
	  implemented).". You may want to remove this notice (or lower the
	  notify severity) if you feel 3DS doesn't have to handle such
	  rotations.
	  The attached archive contains 3 files from 3DS plugin, against
	  rev. 11162.
	  
	  Please note there is still the textures issue for cow.osg. I
	  guess it's because it's not a "flat, dummy and standard" texture
	  in slot 0... That is to say the only thing the writer can handle
	  at the moment. I guess I won't address this soon.
	  "
	  and
	  
	  "I've detected and fixed another bug in 3DS writer: support for
	  automatic splitting of meshes having >65k faces/points was buggy
	  (was deleting faces).
	  Here is my four 3DS modified files (in a ZIP), against rev.
	  11193, including previous fixes AND Stephan's fix about relative
	  filenames."

2010-03-10 14:44  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-03-10 14:29  robert

	* Update SO version number to 66 to skip over 65 value planned to
	  2.8.3

2010-03-10 14:28  robert

	* From Vincent Bourdier, addition of out of memory read result.

2010-03-10 13:48  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've initially added the XML support of the new
	  native osg format,
	  using osgDB::XmlParser. The extension for XML-formatted scenes is
	  .osgx, corresponding to .osgb for binary and .osgt for ascii. It
	  could
	  either be rendered in osgviewer or edited by common web browsers
	  and
	  xml editors because of a range of changes to fit the XML syntax.
	  For
	  example, the recorded class names are slight modified, from
	  'osg::Geode' to 'osg--Geode'.
	  
	  To quickly get an XML file:
	  # ./osgconv cow.osg cow.osgx
	  
	  The StreamOperator header, InputStreram and OutputStream classes
	  are
	  modified to be more portable for triple ascii/binary/XML formats.
	  I
	  also fixed a bug in readImage()/writeImage() to share image
	  objects if
	  needed.
	  
	  The ReaderWriterOSG2 class now supports all three formats and
	  reading/writing scene objects (not nodes or images), thanks to
	  Torben's advice before.
	  "

2010-03-10 13:37  robert

	* From John Ivar Haugland, "This is a fix to InputStream.cpp.
	  (revision 11114) . I have attached the modified file.
	  
	  The options where not passed on to the image reader plugins when
	  reading the new osg2 format files, so I added the options to the
	  osgDB.:readImageFile function call.
	  
	  "

2010-03-10 13:24  robert

	* From Wang Rui, QWidgetImage class that enables QWidgets to be
	  used as an interactive osg::Image that can be assigned to
	  textures.

2010-03-10 12:56  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "as I work in Visual Studio, the
	  introduction of the new osg2 reader/writer gave me a confusing
	  project list, especially the three projects named "Plugins osg".
	  The attached patch changes the project names to "Plugins osg
	  depricated xxx" and "Plugins osg serializer xxx" therefore
	  keeping them close together in the Solution Explorer.
	  "

2010-03-10 12:13  robert

	* Added tests of various FileNameUtils functions, tests invoked by
	  osgunittests filenames

	* From Sukender, "Here is my proposal. I fixed what Paul said,
	  added some doxygen comments, added the function I told about, and
	  removed the two "find('/')"-like calls to use only one."

2010-03-10 11:09  robert

	* From Nico Krulthof and Jori Torres, additions for detecting OSX
	  10.6 SDK and setting variable defaults accordingly.

2010-03-10 11:01  robert

	* Based on a suggestion from Chuck Seberino, have added a section
	  for testing of 64bit build under OSX and disable the use of
	  quicktime when the build includes 64bit.

2010-03-10 10:32  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "my compiler (VC Express 9) gives some
	  warnings (see below) about not being able to generate an
	  assignment operator. As those assignment operators are not used
	  and problably should never be used, I solved this by creating an
	  private (empty) assingment operator.
	  "
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added "return *this;" to Laurens's addition
	  to prevent them generating a warning under gcc...

2010-03-10 10:10  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a small bugfix for the
	  3ds-reader. It allows
	  reading files with relative paths again. (Hard to explain, easy
	  to see
	  in the diff)"

2010-03-10 09:37  robert

2010-03-05 16:17  robert

	* From Wojcoech Lewandowski, "Attched are aimShadowCastingCamera()
	  call changes, I have described in former post. Basically now
	  MinimalShadowMap overrides first variant and keeps second. So
	  both variants of aimShadowCastingCamera are clearly defined in
	  MinimalShadowMap::ViewData scope. This way compilers have no
	  problem and code looks less obscure. Changes made against the
	  trunk."

2010-03-05 16:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Not so long time ago, there was a
	  complaint about the ac3d plugin not honoring
	  absolute filenames for the texture images.
	  
	  The attached change should fix this by at first looking at the
	  absolute file
	  name to load a texture and then, if that fails, strip away any
	  paths to try
	  that again with the bare file name.
	  The change also fixes a possible exception that could be
	  triggered by an out
	  of bounds std::string access which is now avoided by using
	  functions from
	  osgDB/FileUtils.
	  
	  The change is based on rev 11161."

2010-03-05 16:07  robert

	  changing the string when having a dot in a directory.
	  Old behaviour: "abc.d/filename_no_ext" -> "abc"
	  New behaviour: "abc.d/filename_no_ext" -> "abc.d/filename_no_ext"

2010-03-04 12:59  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "Here are a couple more fixes on top of
	  what you've already done." (in reply to fixes submission from
	  Roland Smeenk).

2010-03-04 12:57  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, "I took a quick look at the warnings and they
	  contain nothing serious.
	  Attached you will find updates of the files to hopefully solve
	  the warnings (in VS2005 only one warning occured). In addition I
	  fixed a tiny bug that caused a crash with one of my test files."

2010-03-04 12:43  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Integration of osgText::Font with QFont
	  to enable use of Qt fonts and selectors in osgText.

2010-03-04 12:18  robert

	* Removed now redundent call to register PagedLODs

2010-03-04 11:45  robert

	* Removed old net plugin that is nolonger used. This plugin can be
	  found in the deprecated/src/osgPlugins/net respository

2010-03-03 17:24  robert

	* Ran dos2unix of files to fix issues with file endings

2010-03-03 16:40  robert

	* Refactored DatabasePager so that it nolonger takes
	  ref_ptr<PagedLOD>, but instead uses a custom version of
	  observer_ptr<>.
	  This change should make it possible to delete PagedLOD's
	  independantly from the DatabasePager, and also prevent issues of
	  consistency of the pager when subgraphs when are cached elsewhere
	  in the application such as in the Registry filecache.

2010-03-03 16:37  robert

	* Fixed warning

2010-03-03 16:14  mplatings

	* 

2010-03-03 10:11  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "I tested DJ's fix to stop flicker on
	  Windows + Qt viewer on 2.6.7
	  
	  It solves the problem on XP and Win7 on Qt 4.5 and 4.62
	  It isn't necessary on Linux (ubuntu 8.10/9.04 Qt 4.5/4.6.2) but
	  doesn't cause any harm.
	  But I have #ifdef'ed it with WIN32. I can't test it on 64bit
	  windows (not sure if x64 defines WIN32?)"

2010-03-02 18:18  mplatings

	* 

2010-03-01 13:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-03-01 13:00  robert

	* Added a ShadowTechnique::computeOrthogonalVector(const osg::Vec3&
	  direction) const method for helping compute an appropriate
	  up vector to setViewMatrixAsLookAt(..) codes in osgShadow. This
	  will addresses previous issues that occured when look vectors
	  co-incided with the hard coded up vectors.

2010-03-01 11:52  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Here comes a list of small fixes in
	  StandardShadowMap and derived classes affecting LispSM
	  techniques. Changes made against SVN trunk.
	  
	  Fixes in StandardShadowMap.cpp & MinimalShadowMap.cpp were made
	  for spotlight issues. There were cases when further located
	  spotlights were not shadowing properly.
	  
	  Small tweak in DebugShadowMap & StandardShadowMap.cpp to not
	  limit shadow maps to texture2D (which should also allow texture2D
	  arrays and cube maps). I simply replaced ptr to osg::Texture2D
	  with pointer to osg::Texture. Interpretation of this member could
	  be now changed with change of shaders in derived classes. This
	  may be useful for guys who override LispSM or
	  MinimalBoundsShadowMaps techniques. Could be useful for
	  implementation of PerspectiveCascadedShadowMaps technique for
	  example.
	  
	  ConvexPolyhedron.cpp & DebugShadowMap.cpp contain debug HUD
	  tweaks.
	  
	  Change in ConvexPolyhedron.cpp overcomes the regression problem
	  with color per primitive binding which caused that shadow volume
	  outlines stopped to draw. I simply changed PER_PRIMITIVE to
	  PER_PRIMITIVE_SET and it works again.
	  
	  Other adition is dump method I added to DebugShadowMap which can
	  be used in shadow debugging mode to dump current frame shadow
	  volumes & scene to osg file. It could be then loaded into viewer
	  and freely examined from different angles (which is difficult
	  inside the application if shadow adopts to view and projection).
	  "

2010-03-01 11:29  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, "With the present CMakeLists, the
	  directory ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/include is added to the include
	  path before ${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/include. This causes
	  problems whenever a header file is changed when updating OSG,
	  because cpp files are build against the old header files
	  contained in ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/include rather than the new
	  ones in ${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/include. Inverting the order
	  of the two drectories in the include path solves the problem.
	  
	  Attached is the modified CMakeLists.txt."

2010-02-26 21:31  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-26 16:02  robert

	* updated wrappers

2010-02-26 15:54  robert

	* Added spaces between < > template parts of macros to prevent
	  compile problems when templates as use as macro parameters

2010-02-26 15:40  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Regarding the osg-users thread "mergeGeodes
	  crash", I'm submitting this for consideration as a fix for the
	  problem with the FlattenStaticTransformsVisitor. It seems that
	  the additional nested loop over the Transform's parent was not
	  needed. I'm not sure why it was there, and if it really was
	  unnecessary, then it has probably been resulting in many
	  redundant Nodes for quite some time. Perhaps this fix will result
	  in a cull- and draw-time performance boost."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added copying of the UserData and
	  Descriptions from the transform to the new group.

2010-02-26 15:01  robert

	* From Raymon de Vries, "I've made a small change to
	  DirectShowTexture.cpp: in the options for the directshow plugin
	  it is possible to specify the capture device by number. For
	  instance:
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureVideoDevice", "0");
	  
	  Lines added in getDevice() are:
	  int deviceId = atoi(name.c_str());
	  if(deviceId >= 0 && deviceId < (int)_listDevice.size())
	  return _listDevice[deviceId];
	  
	  This makes it easy to use a capture device without knowing it's
	  name. Attached is the whole file against rev 11044"

2010-02-26 14:41  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "Here's the all-new, all-dancing DAE
	  plugin, with support for reading
	  osgAnimation. It's been tested with the majority of the samples
	  in the
	  COLLADA test repository and works with all of them either as well
	  as, or
	  better than, the version of the plugin currently in SVN.
	  
	  Known issue: vertex animation (AKA morphing) doesn't work at
	  present,
	  but that's a relatively unpopular method of animating so it's not
	  high
	  on my priority list."
	  
	  Follow up email:
	  "I've been informed that the previous DAE submission didn't build
	  on
	  unix, so here's the submission again with the fixes. Thanks to
	  Gregory Potdevin and Benjamin Bozou.
	  Also, my apologies to Roland for not crediting his part in making
	  DAE
	  animation happen, my work was indeed built on top of his work.
	  Thanks
	  also to Marius Heise and of course Cedric Pinson."
	  
	  Changes by Robert Osfield, fixed compile issues when compile
	  without C* automatic conversion enabled in ref_ptr<>
	  and constructor initialization fixes to address some warnings
	  under gcc.

2010-02-26 14:36  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-26 10:13  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The changes are very similar to Magne's, except
	  they now take the near plane into account. The changes are:
	  
	  * Change OcclusionQueryNode::getPassed to take a NodeVisitor
	  rather than the distance from BS center to the eye point. Change
	  where CullVisitor calls this method to use the new parameters.
	  * getPassed now exits early and returns true to avoid blinking /
	  blink-in of geometry for the first frame or for out-of-range LOD
	  children coming back into view.
	  * getPassed now considers the distance from the near plane to the
	  bounding sphere (rather than eye point to bounding sphere) when
	  determining if the viewer is "inside" the bounding sphere or
	  not."

2010-02-26 10:03  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Summary: GL3 deprecates
	  "glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)". In GL3, individual extension
	  strings are queried by looping over GL_NUM_EXTENSIONS and calling
	  "glGetStringi(GL_EXTENSIONS,<index>)".
	  
	  The fix is basically as follows:
	  if( GL3 )
	  Query indexed extension strings.
	  else
	  Query the old way.
	  
	  The "else" branch is re-indented but otherwise shouldn't contain
	  any changes."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added #if !defined(OSG_GLES1_AVAILABLE) &&
	  !defined(OSG_GLES2_AVAILABLE) to new block to prevent it
	  being compiled under GLES where no glGetStringi exists.

2010-02-26 09:48  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, comment fix

2010-02-26 09:33  robert

	* From Sukender, "I tried a tiny change in is83() function and had
	  no crash (under Windows). "osgconv cow.osg cow.3ds" exports a
	  black cow and "osgconv lz.osg lz.3ds" exports tree(s) at
	  (0,0,0)... I guess there are still things to do about
	  non-zero-index textures and multiple instanciation of a node, but
	  at least it doesn't crash."

2010-02-26 09:23  robert

	* From Ryan Kawicki, "I guess I missed these during my testing, but
	  if the database pager has outstanding requests while the
	  application is shutting down, the archive can become invalidated
	  through unsafe calls to ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive. I've made
	  this function return a ref_ptr and change other locations to as
	  needed to conform to the change. I've tested this and no more
	  crashes.
	  
	  Following files from revision 11057 have been attached."

2010-02-26 08:55  robert

	* From Philip Lownman, "The libpng project decided to rename
	  png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8() to
	  png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8() with the 1.2.9 release. This
	  submission fixes builds of the OSG against versions of libpng <
	  1.2.9
	  that don't have the new symbol available. This affects platforms
	  like
	  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 which come with libpng 1.2.7."

2010-02-25 18:17  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, "As discussed on the osg-users list, I have
	  implemented these rules in
	  Text and Text3D:
	  
	  1. A new line should be started after a line's last hyphen or
	  before
	  its last whitespace.
	  2. If no suitable place to break a line is found, just start new
	  line
	  after the last character that fits on the line.
	  3. Whitespace should be removed from the beginning of the new
	  line
	  (already worked in Text, but not in Text3D).
	  
	  Line wrapping looks a lot better now with no more lone periods
	  appearing at the beginning of lines.
	  
	  Also, right-justified text is more accurate now (slashes would
	  hang
	  off the end of lines before). With this new code I spotted one
	  instance where a hyphen stuck out too far, but in general it
	  looks
	  better. Centered text was not perfect before and still isn't, but
	  I
	  can't see any significant increase or decrease in quality. The
	  casual
	  observer would probably never notice a problem.
	  
	  Also fixed a whitespace problem in Text3D. Not all whitespace was
	  being removed from the beginning of lines. Now it is all being
	  removed in the same manner as in Text."

2010-02-25 18:05  robert

	* From Erik Johnson, "There is an issue on win32 if the application
	  hides the cursor using GraphicsWindowWin32::useCursor(false). The
	  cursor has a habit of re-showing itself.
	  
	  To reproduce, on win32:
	  
	  -Run osgViewer in a windowed mode, with the cursor off, as such:
	  osgViewer::Viewer::Windows windows;
	  viewer.getWindows(windows);
	  for(osgViewer::Viewer::Windows::iterator itr = windows.begin();
	  itr != windows.end();
	  ++itr)
	  {
	  (*itr)->useCursor( false );
	  }
	  
	  -Quickly move the cursor into the window (cursor it should be
	  hidden)
	  -Resize the window by dragging the border (notice the cursor
	  changes to "resize" cursor)
	  -Move the cursor back to the inside of the window (notice the
	  cursor is not hidden anymore)
	  
	  The attached SVN patch will set the cursor to a "NoCursor" during
	  useCursor(false). This correctly stores the no cursor state, so
	  it can be rejuvenated after a future cursor change. This patch
	  also fixes a couple instances where a hidden cursor should show
	  itself, like when it's on the title bar, or the window close
	  button."

2010-02-25 18:03  robert

2010-02-25 17:53  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attached is the osgTerrain wrappers, based on the
	  latest SVN version
	  of OSG. I modified the osgDB::InputStream and OutputStream and
	  the
	  PagedLOD wrapper as well. Now all seems to work fine with paged
	  scenes. I've tested with the puget terrain data and the osgdem
	  application from VPB:
	  # osgdem --xx 10 --yy 10 -t ps_texture_4k.tif --xx 10 --yy 10 -d
	  ps_height_4k.tif -l 8 -v 0.1 -o puget.osgb
	  
	  As the ive plugin does, The PagedLOD wrapper now automatically
	  add the
	  latest file path to PagedLODs' databasePath member, to help them
	  find
	  correct child positions. I also changed the image storage
	  strategy of
	  the OutputStream class, to store them inline by default. The osgt
	  extension should also work, in case the image files are also
	  written
	  to the disk.
	  "

2010-02-25 17:18  robert

	* From J.P. Delport: "by some strange circumstance I've stumbled
	  across the following problem:
	  
	  I create a compositeviewer with two views that share a context.
	  One view is deleted.
	  Texture::TextureObjectSet::discardAllTextureObjects is called,
	  but this does not reset _tail. Now the texture object is again
	  created and addToBack is called from
	  Texture::TextureObjectSet::takeOrGenerate. In addToBack (line
	  612) _tail is now not 0 (although the list should be empty) and a
	  loop is created from the texture object to itself. Then when the
	  second view is deleted,
	  Texture::TextureObjectSet::deleteAllTextureObjects loops forever.
	  Setting _tail to 0 fixes it for me (see attached)."

2010-02-25 17:13  robert

	* From Simon Buckley, "Attached is a small change to the file
	  src\osgPlugins\dxf\dxfFile.cpp that allows the dxf reader to skip
	  comments in a dxf file. I found with the existing version and a
	  test file I had that the loader failed when comments were
	  present. I made a very minor change to allow "999" comment codes
	  to be skipped rather than causing load failure."

2010-02-25 17:07  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "There is a function,

2010-02-20 17:36  robert

	* Converted View across to use ObserverNodePath.

2010-02-19 21:03  robert

	* Build fixes for GLES2

2010-02-19 20:58  robert

	* Fixed GLES1/GLES2 build

2010-02-19 20:43  robert

	* Added include of osg/FrameBufferObject to fix GLES1/GLES2 build
	  issue

2010-02-19 20:40  robert

	* Build fix for GLES1 and GLES2

2010-02-19 20:18  robert

	* Moved implementation of Observer destructor and constructor from
	  header into .cpp to avoid possible issues with imports/exports
	  under Windows build.

2010-02-19 20:14  robert

	* Added check against OSG_GL3_AVAILABLE to avoid issues with GL3
	  build under linux

2010-02-19 20:11  robert

	* Added #include <osg/Notify>, convert osg::notify usage to
	  OSG_NOTICE

2010-02-19 19:50  robert

	* Clean up observer_ptr<> and removed the eronous casting of ptr in
	  objectDeleted.

2010-02-19 19:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-19 18:56  robert

	* Removed the uncessary subclassing from osg::Object as this base
	  class is already pullled via ViewerBase

2010-02-19 16:04  robert

	* Added mutex lock to destructor.

2010-02-19 15:41  robert

	* Replaced local mutex with getObserverMutex().

2010-02-19 14:30  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "In order to compile on Windows with
	  Wrappers ON, some exports are still missing on
	  osgPresentation::AnimationMaterialCallback and
	  osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation::CompileSet."

2010-02-19 14:05  robert

	* Removed no longer defined methods and updated wrappers

2010-02-19 09:32  robert

	* Updated contributors list for 2.9.7 release

2010-02-19 09:21  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2010-02-19 09:02  robert

	* Added an InitGlobalMutexes to enforce early construction and
	  hence late destruction of singleton mutexes.

2010-02-18 22:53  robert

	* Added newline.

2010-02-18 22:20  robert

	* From Mourad Boufarguine, fixed typo.

2010-02-18 22:17  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-18 22:17  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-18 21:24  robert

	* Updated version number of OpenThreads to reflect recent changes

2010-02-18 21:21  robert

	* Completed usage of ObserverNodePath to fix longstanding crash
	  that occurred when nodes in parental chain of a newly loaded node
	  had been deleted.

2010-02-18 21:21  robert

	* Refactored the osg::Referenced observerset code so that it now
	  uses a dedicated ObserverSet class,
	  which utilises a global recursive mutex that is dedicated to
	  manage Observer and ObserverSet.
	  
	  The new global mutex for observers avoids problems with deadlocks
	  that were occurring previously when
	  an osg::Refenced object was being deleted at the same time as on
	  osg::ObserverNodePath.

2010-02-18 21:18  robert

	* Replaced use of observer_ptr<> with straight C pointer to avoid
	  thrashing of an observer_ptr<> every frame.
	  
	  Changed include to point to new Observer header

2010-02-18 21:17  robert

	* Added className() to assist with debugging

2010-02-18 21:15  robert

	* Changed controls for changing animation speed to '(' and ')' to
	  avoid overlap with window resize handler.

2010-02-18 20:14  robert

	* Refactored the ReentrantMutex support so that it utilises the
	  underling thread implementation for recusive mutex support.

2010-02-18 09:00  robert

	* Added new setNodePathTo() method

2010-02-17 10:09  robert

	* Fixed double addition of source node when doing
	  ObserverNodPath::setNodePathTo()
	  
	  Fixed comment in Referenced.cpp

2010-02-16 17:38  robert

	* Added className() implementation to help wiht debugging.

2010-02-16 14:05  robert

	* Fixed crash

2010-02-16 11:10  robert

	* Threads safety fixes based on suggestions from Tim Moore.

2010-02-16 08:53  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-02-15 23:47  cedricpinson

	* From Jeremy Moles, add new EaseMotion and add example
	  osganimationeasemotion to demonstrate them

2010-02-15 20:15  robert

	* Upadted wrappers

2010-02-15 20:15  robert

	* Refactor various NodeTracker and MatrixManipulator classes to use
	  the osg::ObserverNodePath and osg::oberserver_ptr<> classes

2010-02-15 20:14  robert

	* Introduced new osg::ObserverNodePath class that robustly manages
	  a NodePath in a thread safe manner,
	  making it easier for users to track a NodePath even when nodes in
	  the path get deleted.

2010-02-15 20:12  robert

	* Refactored the osg::Observer to introduce a new bool
	  Observer::objectUnreferenced(void*) method that adds
	  the extra capability of making it possible for Observers to
	  assume ownership of a object that would otherwsie be deleted.
	  
	  Added a thread safe ref_ptr<T> observer_ptr<T>::lock() method for
	  robust access to an observed object. This
	  makes observer_ptr<> more equivilant to boosts weak_ptr.

2010-02-15 11:36  robert

	* Added osg:: qualifyer to OSG_NOTIFY macro

2010-02-12 11:45  robert

	* Introduced OSG_WARN, OSG_NOTICE, OSG_INFO, OSG_DEBUG convinience
	  macros that map to OSG_NOTIFY(osg::WARN) etc.
	  
	  Introduced the OSG_NOTIFY_DISABLE Cmake variable +
	  include/osg/Config #define to control whether the OpenSceneGraph
	  build
	  should disable the notification system completely. By setting
	  OSG_NOTIFY_DISABLE to ON in CMake and then rebuilding the
	  the OSG you can get a slightly smaller (~1%) and more slightly
	  efficient library which can be good for shipping applications,
	  but with downside of reduced ability to detect runtime problems
	  and their causes.

2010-02-11 11:56  robert

	* From Sukender, "- Added support for extended filenames (=not 8.3)
	  for images: reads without crashing, optionnally write extended
	  filenames (correctly truncate names if option is OFF). Write
	  option is OFF by default.
	  - Improved identifiers generation in duplicate name handling (was
	  limited to 1000 name collisions, which can be very short for some
	  usages).
	  - Set all read/write operations use a custom log function that
	  will redirect lib3DS log to osg::notify() (was only used for
	  streams)
	  - Removed custom code (now uses osgDB::getFilePath())
	  - Added missing supportsOption() calls
	  - Cleaned a few minor things"

2010-02-11 11:17  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "he new GNU linker, "gold", is going to
	  replace soon the current ld in
	  almost all Linux distributions. Although it is 100% compatible
	  with ld,
	  by default it gives an error if a library has unresolved symbols
	  at link
	  time, that is, it has set -Wl,--no-undefined by default. Debian
	  folks
	  have found that libosg.so and libosgDB.so use some functions
	  belonging
	  to libdl.so {dlsym,dlopen,dlclose,dlerror} without linking to it.
	  
	  My changes link those two libraries to libdl.so explicitly in the
	  same
	  way it is already done for libm.so and librt.so."

2010-02-11 11:13  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Just a minor fix of the src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt,
	  change:
	  
	  SET(COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES ${ZLIB_LIBRARY})
	  ...
	  LINK_EXTERNAL(${LIB_NAME} ${OSGDB_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_LIBRARIES})
	  
	  to
	  
	  SET(COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES ZLIB_LIBRARY)
	  ...
	  LINK_EXTERNAL(${LIB_NAME} ${OSGDB_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_LIBRARIES}
	  ${COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES})
	  LINK_WITH_VARIABLES(${LIB_NAME} ${COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES})
	  
	  
	  I notice that the LINK_EXTERNAL macro won't distinguish between
	  debug
	  and release dependences, which means that osgDB will use the
	  release
	  version of zlib for all build configurations. Under Win32, this
	  will
	  cause a manifest problem: all applications using osgDB may
	  complain
	  "failed to start because msvcr80.dll was not found" or similar
	  messages.
	  
	  This change will make it back to normal."

2010-02-11 11:06  robert

	* Fixed the rotation of normals

2010-02-11 09:13  robert

	* Added futher use of readSize/writeSize.

2010-02-10 19:36  robert

	* replaced reading and writing of std::container.size() using
	  InputStream::readSize() and OutputStream::writeSize() to make
	  the type writing more explictly tied to the size type, with use
	  of unsigned int as the default size. This approach
	  ensures that we get the same results under 32 and 64bit builds.

2010-02-10 17:03  robert

	* Added OutputStream::writeSize and InputStream::readSize methods
	  to help out with ensure that 32bit and 64bit builds all
	  use the same 32bit type for sizes.

2010-02-10 16:23  robert

	* Fixed automatic loading of plugins

2010-02-10 15:18  robert

	* Changed NOTIFY to OSG_NOTIFY

2010-02-10 12:48  robert

	* Fixed typo

2010-02-10 12:44  robert

	* Convert NOTIFY to OSG_NOTIFY to avoid problems with polution of
	  users apps with the NOTIFY macro

2010-02-10 11:21  robert

	* Added pruning of requests that haven't been reissued since the
	  last frame.

2010-02-09 19:30  robert

	* Added enabling of threadsafe ref/unref in FileCache.

2010-02-09 18:24  robert

	* Converted osg::notify usage to NOTIFY

2010-02-09 17:39  robert

	* Introduced NOTIFY macro to help out with avoiding using of
	  streams with notification level is below the user defined cutoff.
	  This addition has been introduced to help out with avoid
	  threading performance issues with the Microsoft ostream
	  implementation.

2010-02-09 17:38  robert

	* Added extra elaspedTime_*() methods to help with reporting times
	  in milliseconds etc.

2010-02-04 10:20  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I also did a small fix to the ObjectWrapper
	  header, to add a
	  OSGDB_EXPORT macro to RegisterCompressorProxy, and modified the
	  findCompressor() method to look for custom compressors in
	  libraries
	  such like osgdb_compressor_name.so, which was described in the
	  wiki
	  page chapter 2.4."

2010-02-03 09:35  robert

	* Added #define for GL3 build

2010-02-03 09:35  robert

	* Added #defines for GL3 build

2010-02-02 11:16  robert

	* From Ryan Kawicki, added removal of TXPArchive from
	  ReaderWriterTXP when the TXPNode destructs to fix memory
	  consumption issue relating to leaving unused archives in memory.

2010-02-02 11:02  robert

	* Fixed indentation.

2010-02-01 10:04  robert

	* From Serge Lages, build fix

2010-01-31 18:24  robert

	* Build fixes for build without ref_ptr<> automatic type conversion

2010-01-31 18:23  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, improvements to Inventor find operation

2010-01-31 12:55  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am sending improved version of Inventor
	  plugin. Attaching just
	  modified files, while GroupSoLOD.h and .cpp was deleted. Please,
	  delete
	  it from repository, it is not used any longer and I doubt if it
	  is
	  probably not used for anything meaningful for a while. In the new
	  code,
	  there is no GroupSoLOD. Please, delete it.
	  
	  I am using new plugin version for about 1.5 month so I consider
	  it
	  stable by myself.
	  
	  List of changes:
	  - rewritten Inventor state stack
	  - shaders support
	  - light attenuation support
	  - support for reading from stream (readNode(std::istream& fin,
	  options))
	  - improved grouping node handling (SoSeparator, SoGroup,...)
	  - fixed transformation bug when two SoShapes/Drawables with
	  different transformations are placed bellow one grouping node
	  - introduced preprocessing to handle more advanced usage schemes
	  of SoLOD and SoSwitch nodes
	  - unused code clean up
	  - improved notify messages
	  - animation callbacks fixes
	  - FindInventor.cmake improved finding routines, support for Coin3
	  and Coin4"

	  PagedLOD+ProxyNode

2010-01-28 12:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-28 11:47  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-28 11:44  robert

	* Fixed typo

2010-01-28 10:59  robert

	* From Martin Lambers, "Fix static linking with EXR plugin on
	  MinGW"

2010-01-28 10:45  robert

	* Fom Sukender, "Added copyFile() and comments in FileUtils."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, build fix for linux/gcc and reformating to
	  keep coding style consistent with rest of OSG

2010-01-28 08:59  robert

	* Added files back in with the execution bit correctly disabled.

2010-01-28 08:58  robert

	* Removed files as they all have the incorrectly have the execution
	  bit enabled, will add back in with this fixed.

2010-01-28 08:53  robert

	* From Wang Rui, added osgParticle serializers

2010-01-27 17:12  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a fix for the Quicktime plugin, with
	  the previous version, the size for some videos was not correct,
	  using GetMovieBoundsRgn instead of GetMovieBox returns the real
	  movie size.
	  "

2010-01-27 17:09  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Changes:
	  
	  1. Rewrite the reading/writing exception handlers to work like
	  the ive
	  plugin exceptions.
	  2. Write a header writing/checking function in
	  ReaderWriterOSG2.cpp,
	  which may help decide if the stream is ascii or binary. The
	  readInputIterator() function will return null pointer if the
	  input
	  file is nither osgb nor osgt format, which indicates that the old
	  .osg
	  format could be used here, in case we've merged the two plugins
	  together.
	  3. Add a new ForceReadingImage option in the InputStream, which
	  will
	  allocate an empty image object with the filename if specifed
	  external
	  image file is missed. It may be useful for format converting in
	  some
	  cases.
	  4. Add new osgParticle wrappers, as well as some modification to
	  the
	  osgParticle headers, for instance, change isEnabled() to
	  getEnabled().
	  5. Some fixes to the osg serialization wrappers."

2010-01-27 16:31  robert

	* From Trajce Nikolov, improvements to osgWidget::Input including
	  selection support

2010-01-27 15:53  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2010-01-27 15:37  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, remove unused file, fix crash for old files

2010-01-27 15:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-27 13:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-27 12:24  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "Here a list of changes:
	  Bone now inherit from MatrixTransform. It simplify a lot the
	  update of
	  Bone matrix. It helps to have the bone system more generic. eg
	  it's now
	  possible to have animation data with precomputed bind matrix. The
	  other
	  benefit, is now the collada plugin will be able to use
	  osgAnimation to
	  display skinned mesh. Michael Plating did a great work to improve
	  this
	  aspect, he is working on the collada plugin and should be able to
	  submit
	  a new version soon.
	  The RigGeometry has been refactored so now it works when you save
	  and
	  reload RigGeometry because the source is not touched anymore. The
	  benefit with this update is that it should be now possible to use
	  a
	  MorphGeometry as source for a RigGeometry.
	  
	  The bad news is that the format has changed, so i have rebuild
	  osg-data
	  related to osgAnimation data, updated the blender exporter to
	  export to
	  the new format.
	  The fbx plugin could be touched about this commit, i dont compile
	  it so
	  i can't give more information about it.
	  The bvh plugin has been updated by Wang rui so this one is fixed
	  with
	  the new code of osgAnimation.
	  The examples has been updated to work with the new code too...
	  
	  The example osg-data/example.osg should be remove, it's an old
	  example
	  that does not work.
	  
	  For people using blender the blender exporter up to date is here:
	  http://hg.plopbyte.net/osgexport2/
	  it will be merge to http://hg.plopbyte.net/osgexport/ as soon as
	  the
	  modification will be push in the trunk.
	  "

2010-01-26 17:07  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-26 17:04  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "Wile working with pbuffers I noticed that
	  the Win32 implementation uses the attribute
	  WGL_PBUFFER_LARGEST_ARB.
	  
	  > quote from
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/wgl_pbuffer.txt
	  > The following attributes are supported by wglCreatePbufferARB:
	  >
	  > WGL_PBUFFER_LARGEST_ARB If this attribute is set to a
	  > non-zero value, the largest
	  > available pbuffer is allocated
	  > when the allocation of the pbuffer

	  It notifies the user when the size is not as requested, but I
	  could find no way for the program to detect this. I've added two
	  lines to write the new size back into the _traits, I think this
	  is appropriate, but I am not absolutely sure.
	  
	  In PixelBufferX11 was no support, so I've added
	  GLX_LARGEST_PBUFFER(_SGIX) support, with the same writeback to
	  the _trais.
	  
	  
	  I have tested the GLX_LARGEST_PBUFFER version on linux and the
	  WGL_PBUFFER_LARGEST_ARB with windows, all tested with the
	  modified autocapture I just submitted.
	  
	  
	  "autocapture --pbuffer --window 100 100 18192 18192
	  cow.osg.\[0,0,-22.7\].trans"
	  gives me a 4096x4096 image on my windows machine,
	  and a 8192x8192 image on linux."

2010-01-26 16:59  robert

	* From Trajce Nikolov, various improvements of the workings of

2010-01-26 16:41  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-26 16:30  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin, "This fix just makes a couple of calls to
	  ref_ptr<>::get() to satisfy the compiler.
	  
	  The changes make the build successful under Windows 7/VC2005 and
	  Ubuntu 9.10 with OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION set

2010-01-26 15:37  robert

	  "

2010-01-26 15:08  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am sending one more improvement (separately
	  from Inventor plugin).
	  I found very useful to have a control whether
	  osgView::setCameraManipulator does or does not reset camera to
	  home position.
	  
	  I extended method signature as follows:
	  void setCameraManipulator(osgGA::MatrixManipulator* manipulator,
	  bool resetPosition = true);
	  
	  keeping the current usage intact (default parameter), while
	  enabling user to disable the position reset. That can be useful
	  in the situation when manipulator position was already loaded,
	  for example from a file (user specification), or defined any
	  other way, while we do not want to be reset to home position.
	  Other usability is usage of two manipulators in a modeling
	  program (orbiting around the model, walking on the model) and
	  changing between them while we want to preserve the position of a
	  camera in the change. Games may benefit from it as well when we
	  change from user-defined helicopter manipulator to soldier
	  manipulator because the user escaped the helicopter. The camera
	  will change manipulator but the position is expected to be kept
	  in the transition (provided that user makes the state transition
	  between the two manipulators himself).
	  "

2010-01-26 14:57  robert

	* Removal of redundant spaces at ends of lines

2010-01-26 14:54  robert

	* updated wrappers

2010-01-26 13:05  robert

	* From Lars Nilsson, "Attached is a small program doing
	  intersection calculations, both with and without KdTree. The
	  geometry is a TRIANGLE_STRIP consisting of five vertices, all
	  with the same rather high Z-value. If the intersection
	  calculation uses KdTree, it fails. When I changed osg::Vec3 to
	  osg::Vec3d in a few places in osg::KdTree it finds the correct
	  intersection point."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, I didn't merge the change of parameter type
	  of IntersectKdTree::intersect() as the internal maths is all done
	  in Vec3s. Keeping Vec3 here hasn't effected the test results.

2010-01-26 11:37  robert

	  -added OSG_GLES GL_RGB readPixels support if available
	  (UNTESTED)"

2010-01-26 11:16  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I've removed an underscore in
	  OpenSceneGraph/src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp
	  introduced in svn
	  10915 (5 Jan 2010): "Added support for call root Camera
	  CullCallbacks"
	  
	  
	  
	  It causes a segfault in osgViewer based apps on our linux system
	  (OSG_STEREO=ON OSG_STEREO_MODE=QUAD_BUFFER)
	  
	  Problem does not show when OSG_STEREO=OFF.
	  
	  
	  < 976 else _cullVisitor->traverse(*_camera);
	  > 976 else cullVisitor->traverse(*_camera);
	  
	  Looks like a typo, and removing the _ does fix the problem."

2010-01-26 10:37  robert

	* Changed doxygen comments to signal deprecation of this old IO
	  classes

2010-01-25 18:08  robert

	* Removed inapprorpiate OSGDB_EXPORT

2010-01-25 17:07  robert

2010-01-25 15:24  robert

	* Moved the declaration of osgDB::Field, FieldReader and

	  deprecated .osg parsing code into one place.

2010-01-25 12:48  robert

	* Removed deprecated classes

2010-01-25 11:40  robert

	* Added back in StreamOperation with executation bit disabled

2010-01-25 11:39  robert

	* Temporily removed StreamOperation as it had execution bit enable
	  for it.

2010-01-25 11:03  robert

	* From Wang Rui, refactored the InputStream/OutputStream operations
	  so that the binar/ascii foramts are implemented via subclasses.

2010-01-22 20:47  robert

	* Added RequestQueue destructor and DatabaseRequest::invalidate()
	  and valid() methods to allow the
	  destruction of RequestQueue to remove any pointers held in
	  DatabaseRequest attached to the scene graph, and to
	  prevent their subsequent use in cases where the scene graph is
	  attached to a new DatabasePager.

2010-01-22 20:35  robert

	* Seting the notifcation level of debug message to INFO.

2010-01-22 16:13  robert

	* Reverted fixes for Mingw as they break OSX build

2010-01-22 15:16  robert

	* Renamed ObjectRegistry to ObjectWrapperManager, and replaced it's
	  instance() method usage with assigning a ObjectWrapperManager
	  to the osgDB::Registry. Added a
	  osgDB::Registry::getObjectWrapperManager() for access of this
	  object wrapper manager. This
	  change centralises the singleton management in osgDB.
	  
	  Merged the osgDB::GlobalLookUpTable functionality into
	  ObjectWrapperManger to keep down the number of singletons in use.

2010-01-21 16:26  robert

	* Added extra export for windows build

2010-01-21 16:07  robert

2010-01-20 20:13  robert

	* From Wang Rui, new native binary/ascii format infrastructure and
	  wrappers.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, refactor of Wang Rui's original osg2 into 3
	  parts - parts placed into osgDB, the ReaderWriter placed into
	  src/osg/Plugin/osg and wrappers into
	  src/osgWrappers/serializers/osg

2010-01-20 10:35  robert

	* Inserted /introspection/ into path of osgIntrospection wrappers

2010-01-19 10:31  robert

	  src/osgWrappers/introspection directory, and use genwrapper to
	  generate the new ones

2010-01-18 16:39  robert

	* Added #include <stdio.h> for Mingw build

2010-01-18 16:38  robert

	  ffmpeg plugin code to implement the ImageStream's setVolume
	  method with its AudioSink."

2010-01-15 15:34  robert

	* Removed the old style Serializer, moving it back into
	  VirtuaLPlanetBuilder to make way for the new Serializer that
	  exists in support for the new binary/ascii format.

2010-01-14 15:15  robert

	* Added setting of the charcode during construction of
	  osgText::Font::Glyph()

2010-01-13 18:50  robert

	* Updated rev number for 2.9.7 dev release as ABI compatibility has
	  been broken

2010-01-13 18:50  robert

	* Updated wrappers and supported shadow texture formats

2010-01-13 18:46  robert

	* For backwards compatiblity add a staic void
	  BufferObject::deleteBufferObject(unsigned int contextID,GLuint
	  globj) method.

2010-01-13 14:57  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-13 14:16  robert

2010-01-13 13:31  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-13 13:30  robert

	* Changed get methods to new style ones.

2010-01-13 13:30  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attached are two simple modifications of
	  osg::Sequence and
	  osg::Texture1D classes, for the reason of implementing the I/O
	  serialization feature. In the Sequence header, I've added some
	  more
	  convenient functions: setTimeList/getTimeList,
	  setLoopMode/getLoopMode, setBegin/getBegin, setEnd/getEnd,
	  setSpeed/getSpeed and setNumRepeats/getNumRepeats.
	  
	  In the Texture1D header, fixed:
	  
	  inline void setTextureWidth(int width) const ...
	  
	  to:
	  
	  inline void setTextureWidth(int width) ..."
	  
	  Notes from Robert Osfield, have gone a little further with these
	  changes and have removed some of the original get methods that
	  were out of step with the way the rest of the OSG manages the
	  set/get property pairs.

2010-01-13 13:09  robert

	* Added missing .get()'s

2010-01-13 11:45  robert

2010-01-12 11:12  robert

	* Convert dos line endings

2010-01-12 10:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-11 17:36  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "OK, so here are new changes.
	  
	  1. The node type will be set to ATOM on read of <tag prop="..."
	  ... /> type tags.
	  2. GROUP and NODE are now written using the same code (and not
	  just duplicated code). Also NODE will not be written as an ATOM
	  if it has no children or contents, so you need to set the type to
	  ATOM if you want the <tag ... /> style.
	  3. You had put the write of "/>" for ATOM after the "return
	  true", so it had no effect... Moved to before the return.
	  4. ATOM did not write its properties correctly, fixed.
	  5. As an added bonus, I made the write() method indent the output
	  so it's more readable. It brings a small public interface change
	  but the indent argument has a default value so client code
	  doesn't need to change (if there even is any).
	  6. Another added bonus, I've simplified the write() method a bit
	  by factoring out the write for children and properties into
	  protected methods."

2010-01-11 17:27  robert

	* Added missing .get()

2010-01-11 16:09  robert

	* From Sukender, introduced usage of ref_ptr<> and local
	  scoped_array to address more robust memory management.

2010-01-11 16:03  robert

	* Added desctructor with jas_cleanup().

2010-01-11 14:28  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman,"the current ReaderWriterJP2 has all the
	  code for writing jp2 files (jpeg 2000), but the writing fails on
	  my windows machine (jasper-1.900.1) because the ID for the "jp2"
	  extention is requested before the jas_init() call. (bug
	  introduced in svn 7645 - 10 dec 2007)"

2010-01-11 14:04  robert

	* From Sukender, "a small fix about using non 3-charcacters long
	  file extensions (such as "jpeg", to be converted to "jpg")."

2010-01-08 11:47  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2010-01-08 11:40  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "was testing an osgWidget-based test
	  app I have and noticed that I couldn't move the windows/frames
	  around on the screen anymore. Turns out that the virtual methods'
	  interface changed in the EventInterface base class, the third
	  argument to mouseDrag() is now const, but it was not changed in
	  the derived classes, so it still compiled but the derived-class
	  version was not being called because its arguments differed.
	  
	  Here are the changes that fix it.
	  "

2010-01-08 11:37  robert

	* From Marius Heise, "osgShadow was using single precision
	  variables for light positioning and orientation. This was causing
	  precision problems (shadow jumping) with big databases (eg.
	  geocentric created vpb). This patch fixes this by using double
	  precision variables for light positioning and orientation. It
	  works for all algorithms dreived form
	  osgShadow::StandardShadowMap.
	  "

2010-01-08 11:32  robert

	* From Rob Radtke, "I recently ran into some issues trying to
	  save/load a scene graph as a .ive file. The problems came about
	  because the scene graph contained depth textures in it. I have
	  attached a patch (against the current revision: 10919) that fixes
	  the issues that I encountered. Both attachments contain the same
	  patch--one is a .zip file that contains the modified files and
	  the other is a text patch file. Here is a summary of the changes
	  I made:
	  
	  1) Add getShadowComparison() accessor function to osg::Texture
	  class
	  2) Modify ReaderWriterTiff::writeTifStream() and _readColor() (in
	  Image.cpp) to handle pixelFormat==GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT as if it
	  were GL_LUMINANCE
	  3) Modify the Texture classes of the ive and osg plug-ins so that
	  they save/load the following Texture members:
	  _use_shadow_comparison, _shadow_compare_func and
	  _shadow_texture_mode
	  "

2010-01-08 11:16  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "OcclusionQueryNode was incorrectly marking
	  itself as DYNAMIC, so I removed that code. And I also found some
	  uses of dynamic_cast that could be changed to static_cast.
	  "

2010-01-08 10:52  robert

	* From Sukender, "ReaderWriter3DS.cpp fixes:
	  - Fixed creation of useless intermediate nodes
	  
	  WriterNodeVisitor.cpp fixes:
	  - Fixed naming of textures (path and extension)
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, this submission also came with changes
	  to use of ref_ptr<> and removal of delete[]'s, but these were not
	  merged as they didn't actually fix any memory leaks, and in once
	  instance introduced one.

2010-01-08 10:12  robert

	* Added newline at end of file to fix warning

2010-01-07 19:13  robert

	* Fixed writing out of ATOM.

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, fixed handling of < tag /> xml syntax

2010-01-07 17:20  robert

	* From Chuck Seberino, (submitted by Stephan Huber) Chuck's
	  original message : "I have a patch to submit that fixes the
	  following error when building against OSX 10.6.2."

2010-01-07 16:49  robert

	* From Lilith Bryant, "As discussed previously on the users list.
	  Fixes the redundant calls to
	  glActiveTexture on every State::apply after more than one
	  texunits have been
	  used.
	  
	  This is against 2.9.6 (I think SVN head is the same)
	  
	  Quick Synopsis:
	  
	  New functions:
	  
	  State::applyModeOnTexUnit
	  State::applyAttributeOnTexUnit
	  State::applyModeMapOnTexUnit
	  State::applyAttributeMapOnTexUnit
	  State::applyModeListOnTexUnit
	  State::applyAttributeListOnTexUnit
	  
	  All copies of the normal versions, but they also set the active
	  tex unit if
	  absolutely necessary (i.e. only if they call something OpenGL).
	  
	  State::apply (*2)
	  State::applyTextureAttribute
	  
	  Changed to call the above functions and no longer call
	  setActiveTextureUnit
	  themselves.
	  
	  State::setActiveTextureUnit
	  
	  Made inline, so the benefit of having applyModeOnTexUnit (etc)
	  inline
	  is retained.
	  "

2010-01-07 14:35  robert

	* Added virtual pause() method into osg::AudioSink to support
	  pausing of a movie thread and it's associated audio.
	  
	  Updated osgmovie plugin to use the pause support.

2010-01-07 12:14  robert

	* Refactored the way that osg::Image/ImageSequence manages the
	  update callback that needs to be attached to Textures to make it
	  possible to use the Image::update() mechansim in other subclasses
	  from osg::Image.
	  To enable the automatic attachment of the required update
	  callback to call osg::Image::update(..) subclasses from
	  osg::Image will
	  need to implement the osg::Image::requestUpdateCall() and return
	  true, and implement the osg::Image::update(NodeVisitor*) method
	  to recieve the update call during the update traversal.

2010-01-07 10:01  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2010-01-07 09:45  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a modified fix. It doesn't break the
	  other patch for this plugin as they are for different files. I've
	  only added the file formats handled by default with DirectShow
	  (based on its Wikipedia page)."

2010-01-07 09:43  robert

	* From Lilith Bryant, "This patch fixes a regression (introduced in
	  @ rev 9228), where simple .dae files, that have no material
	  assignments, will cause a crash on load.
	  
	  In particular, the case when the "instance_geometry" element has
	  no "bind_material" sub-element. This is valid, according to the
	  official collada 1.4.1 specification."

2009-12-08 17:25  robert

	* From Sukender, "I experienced as some users before: I tried to

2009-12-08 16:02  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "i have a problem with my application, i
	  am currently playing with Texture2D::SubloadCallback to optimize
	  my image data transfer, and also avoid double buffering when
	  using a drawing thread.
	  There is a small bug with your change and SubloadCallback, the
	  texture object is destroy at each call of Texture2D::apply
	  because the modified count is never updated when using
	  SubloadCallback.
	  I have made a small fix to avoid that, see attachement."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, added an if (_image.valid()) before the
	  getModified() that Fabien added to avoid problems when no _image
	  is assigned but an subload callback is.

2009-12-08 15:39  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-12-08 15:38  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, "> The workaround/solution was to add a
	  block of code at the end of the
	  > loader to un-premultiply the alpha (now in the codebase).
	  
	  Applying the code brightens the semi-transparent portion, but the
	  black edges are still there (same on both osgviewer and
	  FlightGear).
	  Therefore I believe that the alpha channel is completely ignored
	  (on png, gif, tiff, etc...). I tweaked and tweaked and finally
	  got a workaround.
	  
	  Please commit the enclosed file to fix these issues.
	  
	  My workaround is a bit tricky (and some lines are even weird for
	  me), but it resolves the black edges.
	  These workarounds also work on GIF, TIFF, TGA, and PSD as long as
	  I've tested so far.
	  
	  Please read this for more info on this issue:

	  "Here is our freshly baked 3DS reader/writer (named 'v0.5' to
	  differentiate from previous one). Changes are against trunk rev.
	  10819.
	  Short changelog (from rev 10819):
	  - Added 3DS writer
	  - Sync'd with latest lib3DS
	  - Added options, especially "flattenMatrixTransforms" to get the
	  "old" behaviour (else the reader correctly maps to OSG the
	  transforms from the 3DS file).
	  
	  What should be done:
	  - Check with pivot points, with and without
	  "flattenMatrixTransforms" option.
	  - We ran tests on it, but we can never be 100% sure there is no
	  bug. Testing from the community would of course be helpful."

	* From Christian Ehrlicher, "during profiling my program I found

	  (de)allocation going on in OverlayNode::cut().
	  
	  So instead creating inner-loop variables 'distances' and
	  'newVertices'
	  every time, I moved the creation out of the loop and just do a
	  clear() +
	  reserve() inside the loop. This allows std::vector<> to reuse the

	* From Jason Daly, "The DDS reader test for DXT1 images with 1-bit
	  alpha wasn't thorough enough. It performed the first check
	  (color_0 <= color_1), but it didn't actually scan the texel block
	  to see if the transparent color (0x03) was there. As a result,
	  DXT1 files without any alpha were getting switched to RGBA format
	  (instead of being left just RGB).
	  
	  The attached code fixes this problem."

2009-11-27 15:39  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, Explanation:
	  
	  Currently osg2cpp removes "\n" line endings to replace them with
	  a textual equivalent ("\\n") in order for the string representing
	  the shader to contain line endings in the string. But if the file
	  that was read contained Windows line endings ("\r\n"), the
	  resulting file looked really weird (the \r were left there and
	  editors interpreted that as an additional newline). Also, I can
	  imagine that if the shader file that was read had Mac line
	  endings ("\r") then the output shader would all end up in one
	  long line since there are no "\n"...
	  
	  What I've done:
	  
	  I've added a search and replace of "\r\n" to "\n", and then "\r"
	  to "\n" (note that the order is important).
	  
	  I've also changed the filename handling so that the output file
	  will be put in the same directory as the input file in case it
	  was specified with a path. Previous functionality is retained for
	  files specified with the filename only.""

	* From Wang Rui, "I just successfully built the pdf plugin on

	* From Paul Martz, "This change address the following issue: an app
	  opens a Viewer on a multidisplay system, configured to
	  setUpViewAcrossAllDisplays, with a non-default clear mask. In
	  this case, OSG failed to propagate the clear mask to the slave
	  Cameras, resulting in the clear mask being ignored. To fix this
	  issue, this revision adds a new CullSettings::VariablesMask bit,
	  CLEAR_MASK, to explicitly control inheritance of the clear mask.
	  This bit is set by default, which means that the clear mask now
	  inherits by default, whereas previously it did not."

2009-11-27 12:21  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "I discovered what seems to be a missing call
	  to FreeLibrary for osgDB.dll The result of this is that it
	  prevents me from dynamically unloading my DLL (which uses OSG).
	  This is because initialisation of the osg::Registry instance
	  results in a call to GetModuleHandleEx (to get the filename of
	  the DLL). This call to GetModuleHandleEx increments the module
	  refcount, but there was no matching call to FreeLibrary for the
	  returned handle. Unlike the old GetModuleHandle function,
	  GetModuleHandle does (by default) increment the refcount.
	  
	  I have added the missing call to FreeLibrary in
	  osgDB::FileUtils., and now my the runtime unload of MY dll is
	  working properly. It has also cured some related problems I was
	  having with memory leak checks being reported.

2009-11-21 16:41  robert

	* From Colin MacDonald, "In my application I have a custom graphics
	  context class, derived from
	  osg::GraphicsContext, in order to give good integration with the
	  application's GUI toolkit. This works really well.
	  
	  However, I need to share OpenGL texture resources with the
	  standard
	  osgViewer GraphicsContext implementations, in particular the
	  PixelBuffers. This is essential for my application to conserve
	  graphics
	  memory on low-end hardware. Currently the standard osg
	  implementations
	  will not share resources with another derived
	  osg::GraphicsContext,
	  other than the pre-defined osgViewer classes e.g. PixelBufferX11
	  is
	  hardcoded to only share resources with GraphicsWindowX11 and
	  PixelBufferX11 objects, and no other osg::GraphicsContext object.
	  
	  To address this in the cleanest way I could think of, I have
	  moved the
	  OpenGL handle variables for each platform into a small utility
	  class,
	  e.g. GraphicsHandleX11 for unix. Then GraphicsWindowX11,
	  PixelBufferX11
	  and any other derived osg::GraphicsContext class can inherit from
	  GraphicsHandleX11 to share OpenGL resources.
	  
	  I have updated the X11, Win32 and Carbon implementations to use
	  this.
	  The changes are minor. I haven't touched the Cocoa implmentation
	  as
	  I'm not familiar with it at all and couldn't test it - it will
	  work
	  unchanged.
	  
	  Without this I had some horrible hacks in my application, this
	  greatly
	  simplifies things for me. It also simplifies the osgViewer
	  implementations slightly. Perhaps it may help with other users'
	  desires to share resources with external graphics contexts, as
	  was
	  discussed on the user list recently."
	  
	  Notes from Robert Osfield, adapted Colin's submission to work
	  with the new EGL related changes.

2009-11-20 14:51  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, " Remove vestigial (and because it was
	  undocumented, potentially harmful) code to ignore
	  filenames starting with a dash "-" character from the
	  (std::vector<std::string>&) version
	  of osgDB::readNodeFiles. Handling of argument strings is properly
	  implemented in the
	  osgDB::readNodeFiles(osg::ArgumentParser& arguments,const
	  Options* options)
	  variant, which most code uses. The (std::vector<std::string>&)
	  version is only called by
	  the osgconv utility, which does its own argument handling and
	  stripping prior to calling
	  readNodeFiles().
	  
	  Also, documented this behaviour in the header comments.
	  
	  I believe this code removal is a meritful change because leavign
	  the code in causes an
	  unexpected and undocumented behaviour (ignoring any filename
	  starting with a dash) that
	  could bite users in the future. This behaviour is not needed for
	  existing functionality
	  because existing code uses other APIs to handle dash-prefixed
	  arguments anyway.

2009-11-20 14:39  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I've made a small fix to osgViewer/Scene.cpp,
	  which is already attached. I would like to explain what I've done
	  and why.
	  
	  In Scene::updateSceneGraph(), change:
	  
	  if (getSceneData())
	  {
	  updateVisitor.setImageRequestHandler(getImagePager());
	  getSceneData()->accept(updateVisitor);

	  updateVisitor.setImageRequestHandler(getImagePager());
	  getSceneData()->accept(updateVisitor);

	  That is, just swap the positions of two 'if () {...}' segments.
	  
	  While working on a paged terrain, I need to collect every newly
	  allocated PagedLODs and make them temporarily unrenderable in the
	  next frame, which are all done in a update callback. But I found
	  that these PagedLODs will always be shown before collecting them,
	  because of the unsuitable sequence in Scene::updateSceneGraph().
	  DatabasePager is synchronized AFTER the user updating traversal,
	  that is, user cannot IMMEDIATELY find out changes made by
	  DatabasePager.

	  If OSG is compiled without the flag COMPILE_ASSEMBLY (default

2009-11-20 11:39  robert

	* From Himar Carmona, " this submission resolves an issue regarding
	  the setup of a slave camera with an (incorrect) coding style.
	  Sharing the same instance of osg::Viewport with a camera and a
	  slave camera causes incorrect rescaling in
	  GraphicsContext::resizedImplementation, due to the viewport being
	  rescaled twice (once per camera). Though viewports sharing is not
	  intentional, it can be done with the current version of OSG and
	  be a potential pitfall for anyone.
	  
	  As Robert pointed out, i opted for modifying the resize code
	  where the break is to minimize code changes, avoiding the
	  duplicate resize of the viewport with the use of a vector and a
	  search for duplicates. Not very elegant (avoiding an effect of a
	  cause), another approach could be ripping out the method
	  osg::Camera::setViewport(osg::Viewport*) which is more inline
	  with Roberts rationale behind not to share viewports between
	  cameras and left only its overloaded method
	  setViewport(x,y,width,height). But this approach need some
	  refactoring due to the intense use of the method. Notice also
	  that the resize works well without this change if no sharing
	  occurs, and the user of the method can opt for always call
	  setViewport with a new instance.
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, changed this submission to use an
	  std::set<Viewport*> rather than an std::vector<> as it keeps the
	  code a bit cleaner and more compact.

	* From Stewart Andreason, "When I open the Window Attributes (in

	  does not have a class defined. The Window Specification and Save
	  buttons are greyed out.
	  
	  For example, when running FlightGear, I want the window to always
	  have no title, so it opens full-screen without using the
	  --full-screen option, which would prevent other windows from
	  moving above the osg window.

	* From Jason Beverage, "I posted a question on osg users about
	  resources not being properly released when using osgTerrain
	  databases and multiple viewers are used a few weeks ago and I've
	  found that at least part of the problem comes down to the fact
	  that the nodes that are traversed by the GeometryTechnique are
	  never actually added to the scene graph, and thus don't have
	  releaseGLObjects called on them. I'm submitting a few changes
	  that takes care of this by allowing the TerrainTechnique to
	  provide a releaseGLObjects implementation. I've applied these
	  changes in osgEarth and this example program no longer crashes on

	* From Jeremy Moles, "Somehow, the SVG reader plugin has gone all
	  this time without actually
	  being able to accurately provide the cool stuff that SVG is good
	  for. :)
	  There is a one-line bug on line 68 in the

	* From Cedric Pinson, "Here an update of the directshow plugin. It
	  fixes issues with
	  synchronization, improve capture device support.
	  
	  here how to use it to display a capture device:
	  
	  osg::Options* options = new osg::Options;
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureWantedWidth", "800");
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureWantedHeight", "600");
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureWantedFps", "30");
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureVideoDevice", "USB Video
	  Device" );
	  options->setPluginStringData("captureSoundDevice", "");
	  then
	  osgDB::readImageFile("capture.directshow", options)
	  you can use a graphedit application to list devices available in
	  directshow.
	  
	  
	  for classic avi file you just need to do a
	  osgDB::readImageFile("file.avi.directshow");
	  You will need of course to install the codec needed by directshow
	  to
	  read the avi files.
	  
	  I recommand this tool http://avicodec.duby.info/, that check
	  which
	  video/sound codec is needed to play an avi file.
	  
	  
	  You can test it with the osgmovie example.

	* From David Fries, "I was trying to create a lot of threads under
	  32 bit Linux, but could
	  only create 376, then the program would hang.
	  376 * 8MB stack per thread = 3008 MB
	  The stack size allocated per thread blew the process address
	  stack.
	  To get more threads you have to specify a smaller per thread
	  stack,
	  but while the Thread::start says it will limit the stack size to
	  the
	  smallest allowable stack size, it won't let it be smaller than
	  the
	  default. I included the limits.h header to use PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
	  as
	  the minimum stack size.
	  
	  As for the deadlock, if the pthread_create failed, the new thread
	  doesn't exist and doesn't call threadStartedBlock.release(), so
	  the
	  existing thread deadlocks on threadStartedBlock.block(). Only
	  block
	  if the thread was started."

2009-11-20 09:03  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, removal of declaration of now undefined method.

2009-11-19 17:42  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a bugfix for
	  removeTransformUpdating and another
	  similar remove-method.
	  
	  The old code removed an element from a vector, which invalidates
	  the
	  iterator of the loop This resulted in a crash on certain
	  platforms. Now
	  the erasing is done the right way without invalidating the
	  iterator."

2009-11-19 17:27  robert

	* From Lilin Xiong, added missing OSG_EXPORT

2009-11-19 17:22  robert

	* From Vincent Gadoury, "In osgViewer::Viewer and
	  osgViewer::CompositveViewer, the DOUBLECLICK event type was not
	  considered as a "pointer event" and thus was receiving the event
	  state coordinates and button mask. As a result, a double-click
	  event always had a button mask not including the double-clicked
	  button, even if double-click event is a "button push" event.
	  
	  The modification consists only in including
	  osgGA::GUIEventAdapter::DOUBLECLICK in the list of "pointerEvent"
	  events.
	  
	  Test done to reproduce the problem and check the fix: in any osg
	  application or example with an HandleInput function, break on
	  events with a double-click event type. Without the changes, the
	  event's buttonMask does not contain the double-clicked button.
	  With the changes, it does.
	  
	  Only simple tests (running some examples and playing with the
	  mouse) were done to check that the changes do not break anything,
	  since double-click is not used thoroughly in OSG.
	  
	  Modification done against current SVN Trunk version (r10753).
	  
	  As this is a fix, I do not wish to keep my copyright on this
	  submission and assign it over to the project lead.

	* From Donn Mielcarek, "I'm surprised this hasn't come up before,
	  but the function Thread::setProcessorAffinity

2009-11-19 12:54  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "ttached are some tweaks to the Obj loader
	  that allows a program supplied osgDB::Options object to be passed
	  through the code. This allows for caching to be used with images.
	  
	  The patched loader also complains more loudly if a material
	  library file wasn't found or if a referenced material wasn't
	  found in the material library."

2009-11-19 12:39  robert

	* From Tugkan Calapoglu, "we started to have problems with textures
	  after a recent svn update. I
	  was able to follow the problem until following addition to
	  Texture.cpp:
	  
	  // GLES doesn't cope with internal formats of 1,2,3 and 4 so map
	  them to
	  the appropriate equivilants.
	  
	  if (_internalFormat==1) _internalFormat = GL_ALPHA;
	  if (_internalFormat==2) _internalFormat = GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA;
	  if (_internalFormat==3) _internalFormat = GL_RGB;
	  if (_internalFormat==4) _internalFormat = GL_RGBA;
	  
	  
	  The problem is that internal format "1" corresponds to
	  GL_LUMINANCE, not
	  GL_ALPHA. I double checked this from the Red Book. Fixed version
	  is
	  attached to the email."

2009-11-19 12:01  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I've made a change to the
	  ScreenCaptureHandler's addCallbackToViewer method, so that it
	  iterates over GraphicsContexts instead of GraphicsWindows. When
	  the viewer has a pbuffer (for offscreen rendering without a
	  window) then it wouldn't add the WindowCaptureCallback to that
	  context since it wasn't in the list returned by
	  ViewerBase::getWindows(). And anyways, I originally wrote the
	  code, and I didn't see any reason why I did it with windows
	  instead of contexts...
	  
	  I've needed to run a recorded simulation offscreen and save it to
	  a sequence of images, and the ScreenCaptureHandler seemed to be
	  the simplest way to do that, and with this change it's possible.
	  
	  
	  Another change: I've also added the ability to specify continuous
	  capture of all frames, or a certain number of frames.
	  ScreenCaptureHandler now has a setFramesToCapture(int) method.
	  The argument will be interpreted as:
	  
	  0 : don't capture
	  <0 : capture continuously
	  >0 : capture that number of frames then stop
	  
	  I also added startCapture() and stopCapture() methods so that
	  user code can start capturing (either continuously or the given
	  number of frames) at a given point in their program.
	  setFramesToCapture() won't start capturing, you have to call
	  startCapture() afterwards. The handler also now has another key
	  to toggle continuous capture (defaults to 'C').
	  
	  Note that continuous capture will of course only work if the
	  CaptureOperation writes to different files (for example, a
	  WriteToFile with SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) or does something
	  different each time... Otherwise it will just overwrite of
	  course. :-)
	  
	  I've also taken the chance to refactor the addCallbackToViewer()
	  method a bit too, since finding the right camera is needed in two
	  places now.
	  
	  I've tested all cases (I think). If you want to try, in
	  osgviewer.cpp and replace the line
	  
	  // add the screen capture handler
	  viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler);
	  
	  with
	  
	  // add the screen capture handler
	  osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler* captureHandler = new
	  osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
	  new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler::WriteToFile(
	  "screenshot", "jpg",
	  osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler::WriteToFile::SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER),
	  -1);
	  viewer.addEventHandler(captureHandler);
	  captureHandler->startCapture();
	  
	  And vary the "-1" (put 0, 10, 50) and then use the 'c' and 'C'
	  keys and see how it reacts.

	* From Michael Platings, "This plugin adds support for the Autodesk
	  FBX file format. It imports animations, including skeletal and

	  works
	  quite well, constraint triangulation is not an easy task... I
	  have
	  encounter some crash during the development that the following

	  fix.
	  The two fixes are :
	  - Fix in removeVerticesInside() : needs to take into account
	  UByte and
	  UShort version of DrawElements to avoid a crash later
	  - Fix a crash in triangulate() : detect degenerate adjacency case

2009-11-19 10:47  robert

	* Fixed build

2009-11-19 10:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-11-19 10:10  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Building on earlier Paul's submission
	  "[osg-users] Main branch MSFBO support change", I have added
	  implicit buffer mask variables to DisplaySettings for setting
	  global defaults for Camera FBOs. These mask variables are named
	  after variables in Camera class. In Paul's submission they were
	  named _renderBufferMask & _resolveBufferMask but I renamed them
	  to _implicitBufferAttachmentRenderMask &
	  _implicitBufferAttachmentResolveMask. DisplaySettings
	  implementation includes reading of environment vars and command
	  line options. Setters and getters follow typical OSG naming
	  convention. I also updated names of ImplictBufferAttachment enum
	  bits to match changed naming scheme.
	  
	  DisplaySettings now define COLOR and DEPTH as defaults for
	  implicit buffers. Consequently Camera by default uses the same
	  defaults through USE_DISPLAY_SETTINGS_MASK. However, particular
	  Camera mask can be easily overriden through
	  Camera::setImplicitBufferAttachmentMask method. I hope, that in
	  this way we can have global control over implicit buffer
	  defaults, and we can still retain fine grained control at Camera
	  level.
	  
	  I have also replaced original unsigned ints used to store masks
	  to signed ints because complier resolves enums as signed integer
	  (I got a number of warnings with unsigned int)."

	* From Lee Butler, "The attached ZIP file contains a modified OBJ
	  file format reader which
	  makes smoothing optional for verticies which do not have a normal
	  associated with them in the OBJ input file. The previous behavior
	  was
	  to always smooth at all verticies which did not have surface
	  normals.
	  In this new implementation smoothing is on by default to be
	  compatible
	  with previous behavior. The user can now specify the
	  "generateFacetNormals"
	  option to the reader to use facet normals for verticies where the
	  OBJ
	  file does not specify a normal."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, changed "noSmoothing" naming used by
	  Lee to "generateFacetNormals".

2009-11-18 13:00  robert

	* From Pau Garcia i Quiles, "On Linux/Unix, when you change the
	  system time (for instance, using
	  settimeofday), OSG animations will freeze your application
	  because
	  osg::Timer uses gettimeofday internally on non-Win32 platforms.
	  This
	  is wrong and should be replace with times(2) or clock_gettime(2).
	  
	  The attached patch fixes the issue in a binary-compatible way by
	  using
	  clock_gettime when it's available, and falling back to
	  gettimeofday
	  when it's not."

2009-11-18 12:50  robert

	* Fixed primCount default value

2009-11-18 12:15  robert

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "Attached the collected fixes I needed
	  to compile with all of them.
	  Most notable the __hpux define stuff. The __hpux__ variant seems
	  to be not
	  defined which resulted in a compile error at this time.
	  Consequently I have
	  replaced all occurances of __hpux__ with __hpux. And huge
	  surprise: now osg
	  plugins are found and loaded correctly ...
	  The next notable one is the MSVC_IDE fix which makes the nmake
	  Makefiles cmake
	  generator target behave like the ide one. Showed up because I
	  started to do
	  scripted builds with nmake instead of devenv...
	  The rest is the usual bunch of stuff that just happens during

	  optional

2009-10-11 05:52  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "A recent change to add the new geometry shader
	  primitive types has broken the build on Windows. On Windows,
	  those types are declared in the header GL2Extensions, but the
	  PrimitiveSet header (which uses those types) fails to include
	  that header, causing compile errors.
	  
	  Attached is a version of PrimitiveSet that includes
	  GL2Extensions."

2009-10-10 14:50  robert

2009-10-10 11:26  robert

	* From Simon Julier, "Please find attached FindCOLLADA.cmake with a
	  patch for a framework naming issue for Mac platforms.
	  
	  The collada dom Makefiles actually build a framework called
	  Collada14Dom.framework (debug: Collada14Dom-d.framework). The
	  current CMake rules, however, only look for collada14dom.
	  Normally, the difference in case wouldn't matter but the rule
	  fails on case sensitive HPFS partitions.
	  "

2009-10-10 11:06  robert

	* From Cesar L.B. Silveira, "I have written these few lines of code
	  which allow setting the label
	  of an osgWidget::Label with an osgText::String. I had to do this
	  on a
	  project I'm working on, because I needed UTF-8 strings on my
	  labels,
	  and using setLabel with std::string was not working.
	  "

2009-10-10 11:00  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Tha attached change adapt previous
	  attemps to get our application using osg
	  through microsofts application verifier. The current change
	  should work a
	  little better ...
	  The change is based on rev 10605."

2009-10-10 10:58  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This change eliminate an orphan stats
	  block that sticks somewhere in the
	  screen stats display."

2009-10-10 10:54  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-10-10 10:07  robert

	* From David Fries, "The Extensions object was calling
	  _gl_get_query_objectui64v but
	  checking _gl_get_query_objectuiv_arb which is a different
	  function
	  pointer. Changed to check the function being called.
	  
	  This is against the subversion trunk."

2009-10-10 10:00  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "I discovered a memory leak in the ZIP plugin,
	  which was caused by a missing call to CloseZip.
	  I attach a modified ReaderWriterZIP.cpp (based on version 2.9.5
	  revision 10374).
	  This includes a little bit of code tidying, but the only
	  functional change is a test of the return value of OpenZip and
	  the addition of a call to CloseZip."

2009-10-10 09:53  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "ref_ptr usage changes made on 9th of
	  June broke VirtualProgram used in osgShaderCompositor example.
	  Taking the opportunity I modified the code a little to use earth
	  sphere as default model. Cow.osg used previously was not looking
	  good in advanced example. I also changed default to advanced
	  example, because its more informative with labels describing
	  virtual programs used to render the objects."

2009-10-10 09:45  robert

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch wich add two missing
	  GL modes in the osg plug'in."

2009-10-10 09:44  robert

	* To fix warning removed unncessary , from end to enum list.

2009-10-10 09:41  robert

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch wich improves the
	  support for geometry shaders in OpenSceneGraph.
	  It adds new PrimitiveSet constants for the specific geometry
	  shader primitive types :
	  - LINES_ADJACENCY
	  - LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY
	  - TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY
	  - TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY
	  It also adds some missing features to the glsl reader plug'in.
	  "

2009-10-10 09:38  robert

	* From Roger James, "When you merged my last set of changes into
	  FindCOLLADA.cmake you omitted the changes to find the DOM22
	  libraries. Collada 1.4 DOM 2.2 seems to work OK for me on windows
	  platforms. I have attached the changes again if you want to apply
	  them."

2009-10-10 09:35  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "Here an update of osganimationtimeline
	  example, the callback did not
	  follow the callback api, i updated to fix this, then the callback
	  are
	  called correctly."

2009-10-10 09:26  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "osgWidget::Window::setWindow() calls
	  parented() (which does an addChild()) on the new window, but it
	  does not call unparented() (which does a removeChild()) on the
	  old window before. So it works fine if there was no window
	  previously, but if an app creates new windows and calls
	  setWindow() to replace the previous one, they will all add up
	  instead and be on top of each other...
	  
	  This is fixed in the file attached."

2009-10-10 09:23  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "imageio plugin fix, mac os x : remove
	  double-qualified ctor - illegal syntax under gcc 4.2.1"

2009-10-10 09:20  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "fix for 10.6/darwin: this fix changes what i

	* Introduced new BufferObject design + implementation in
	  preperation of implementing a pool system for buffer objects

2009-10-01 17:08  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings, In Target, the default constructor is
	  explicitly called on _target. This is necessary for FloatTarget
	  and DoubleTarget so that _target is initialised to 0, otherwise
	  you get a junk value. In MorphGeometry.cpp, UpdateMorph::link now
	  links channels of the same index to the same target. Previously a
	  new FloatTarget was created for each channel, so multiple
	  animations didn't work.

2009-09-27 15:21  robert

	  TexturePool implementation.
	  
	  The Texture Pool can be enabled by setting the env var
	  OSG_TEXTURE_POOL_SIZE=size_in_bytes.
	  Note, setting a size of 1 will result in the TexturePool
	  allocating the minimum number of
	  textures it can without having to reuse TextureObjects from
	  within the same frame.

2009-09-25 18:03  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-09-24 10:11  robert

2009-09-09 15:22  robert

	* Added reset of the ImageDetails values of TexelOffset and
	  TexelScale.

2009-09-09 13:31  robert

	* Added support for using the ImageDetails to fill in the Locator
	  and TexelScale/Offset values in the ImageLayer

	  include/osgAnimation/AnimationManager and
	  src/osgAnimation/AnimationManager.cpp

2009-09-09 09:52  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings, I have removed Target::normalize() as
	  calling it was incorrect - the interpolation is already done in
	  such a way that the Target's value is always normalized.
	  Finally, I have fixed TemplateTarget<osg::Quat>::lerp() as it was
	  giving incorrect results when interpolating between some small
	  rotations.
	  From Cedric Pinson, i renamed the method in channel to be more
	  general. Adjusted the CubicBezier key constructor to use a single
	  value as input.

2009-08-31 09:40  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, The following modification are
	  Update Timeline.cpp to add current layer to the ActionVisitor,
	  use correctly the priority
	  Add accessors in Action.cpp to retrieve protected data
	  Split files and rename them to classname
	  Change de default color of UpdateMaterial to FFOOFF to detect
	  unset value
	  Add accessors in LinkVisitor instead of accessing data directly
	  Update osganimationtimeline example to fit the api callback

2009-08-27 19:25  robert

	* Fixed the compute of the extents/bounding sphere

2009-08-27 16:42  robert

	* Added support to .p3d format's volume tag for the properties:
	  
	  region="xmin ymin zmin xmax ymax zmax"
	  alpha="float_value"
	  cutoff="float_value"
	  sampleDenstiy="float_value"

2009-08-27 16:21  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings, I've moved the matrix updating from
	  UpdateSkeleton to UpdateBone. UpdateSkeleton now merely checks
	  that Bones appear before other children and issues a warning if
	  this isn't the case

2009-08-26 16:39  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings, I've just added a few simple accessors I
	  found necessary

2009-08-26 09:24  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings,
	  - Animations with equal priority are now weighted correctly
	  relative to each other
	  - (minor) Channels no longer store their weight as the only time
	  it's used is in update() when Animation can pass in the weight
	  directly
	  From Cedric Pinson,
	  - I adjusted the quaternion blending to keep the commutativy
	  property

2009-08-22 17:13  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "the DAE importer was crashing when
	  calling osg::Object::setName with a null pointer argument. Rather
	  than trying to fix all the places this might happen and probably
	  missing a few, I thought it would be better to trivially validate
	  the input in setName. With this fix if setName is called with a
	  null pointer then the name is cleared."

2009-08-21 13:55  robert

	* Fixed osgAnimation wrappers

2009-08-21 12:53  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-08-21 11:31  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "At the end of the void function
	  osg::Animation::TemplateStepInterpolator::getValue the code tries
	  to return
	  the result rather than assigning it to the result parameter
	  reference.
	  
	  The following patch fixes this."

2009-08-21 10:18  robert

	* Fixed handling of double precision bounding sphere type.

2009-08-21 09:54  robert

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "I just add the a missing getView()
	  function to the WindowManager."

2009-08-21 09:43  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, part of the FBO attachment submission

2009-08-21 09:42  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-08-21 09:34  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, support for FBO's without colour or
	  depth attachments.
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, I've temporarily re-enabled the old
	  focing of of color and depth attachment to avoid regressions on
	  some OpenGL driver. We'll revist this once
	  we have a mechanism for controlling this override at runtime.
	  
	  #define FORCE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT 1
	  #define FORCE_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT 1

2009-08-20 16:39  robert

	* From Magnus Kessler, "osgAnimation/Interpolator includes itself.
	  The following patch removes the
	  superfluous include"

2009-08-20 16:05  robert

	* From Tom Moore, "Parens were being returned when the bracket keys
	  were typed. The fix
	  is easy and the original code looks like a typo"

2009-08-20 15:32  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "This file didn't build when
	  OSG_USE_UTF8_FILENAME was on"

2009-08-20 15:20  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "There is a duplicate class definition in
	  the obj & dxf plugins trunk,
	  causing static builds to fail."

2009-08-20 14:59  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The bsp & mdl plugins have calls to atof()
	  without including the
	  associated <stdlib.h> header. This breaks the build on my Solaris
	  setup.
	  
	  Rather than adding the missing <stdlib.h> include, I have changed
	  the
	  atof() calls to osg::asciiToDouble(). This is the same as was
	  done
	  throughout the other plugins recently, for locale independance.
	  
	  I've attached updates to the svn trunk, the fix is also
	  appropriate for
	  the 2.8.* branch."

2009-08-20 14:59  robert

	* Added check against a minimual video size of 10x10 to prevent
	  problems with swscale reporting errors and crashing on small
	  video dimensionsline, and those below, will be ignored--
	  
	  M ffmpeg/FFmpegImageStream.cpp

2009-08-20 14:20  robert

	* Improved the custom cursor code and release and compute settings

2009-08-20 14:19  robert

	* From Ronald van Maarseveen and Robert Osfield, changed compute of
	  up vector and localToWorld transform so that it takes in to
	  account the geographic latitude.

2009-08-19 15:36  robert

	* Fixed typo

2009-08-19 15:36  robert

	* Added support for trimming the contents of parsed Xml graph

2009-08-17 15:46  robert

	* Added support for the TabBoxTrackballDragger

2009-08-17 15:45  robert

2009-08-17 15:24  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-08-17 15:22  robert

	* Moved static string initialization into singleton method

2009-08-06 12:40  cedricpinson

	* From Michael Platings,
	  Changes to allow osgAnimation::*CubicBezierChannel to be used
	  Added TemplateStepInterpolator class

2009-08-06 10:57  robert

	* Added a viewer.frame() call prior to the useCursor(false) calls
	  to avoid a threading crash under X11

2009-08-06 10:06  robert

	* Fixed custom cursor support

2009-08-05 17:01  robert

	* Added support for selecting the TabBoxTrackballDragger using
	  dragger="trackball-box"

2009-08-05 16:02  robert

2009-08-05 14:37  robert

	* Added support for volume tags with properties:
	  
	  dragger="box" or dragger="trackball"
	  
	  and
	  
	  technique="light" or technique="isosurface" or technique="iso" or
	  technique="mip"
	  
	  and
	  
	  tf="transferfunctionfile.tf"
	  
	  i.e.
	  
	  <volume dragger="box">CardiacCT</volume>
	  <volume tf="colour.tf">CardiacCT</volume>
	  <volume technique="isosurface">CardiacCT</volume>

2009-08-05 12:51  robert

2009-08-05 11:06  robert

	* Moved the updating and expiry of the Registry object cache from
	  DatabasePager into osgViewer::Viewer/CompositeViewer.

2009-08-04 16:19  robert

	* Updated the Present3D version number

2009-08-03 09:48  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, Add UpdateMaterial callback to animate
	  material\nUpdate LinkVisitor to traverse stateset\nUpdate
	  ReaderWriter to read osgAnimation::UpdateMaterial
	  Callback\nUpdate nathan.osg data file to demonstrate the

	* Fixed bug in handling of stereo image pairs

2009-07-24 15:55  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-07-24 15:30  robert

	* From Lee Butler and Robert Osfield, doxygen comment explaining
	  role of NodeMask

2009-07-24 15:09  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "This set of changes reworks the BSP plugin to
	  use TexEnvCombine instead of a GLSL program for doing the texture
	  blending on displaced terrain geometry. After working with it a
	  while, I found this method to be more scene graph friendly (at
	  least until Wojtek gets his VirtualProgram scheme working ;-) )
	  
	  Note that this technique will require ARB_texture_env_crossbar
	  (or NV_texture_env_combine4), as it mixes two textures in the
	  first texture unit, and just does the lighting in the second. I
	  doubt this will be a problem for any card that can already handle
	  GLSL programs, though."

2009-07-24 15:04  robert

	* From Cory Riddell, "The spherical manipulator uses a middle drag
	  event for panning. It was
	  panning for left-right drags, but was zooming for up-down drags.
	  I
	  changed it to pan both directions as I believe that is the
	  correct
	  behaviour. If the original combination pan-zoom behaviour was
	  intentional, please let me know."

2009-07-24 14:59  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, "Okay, here are the mods I wrote for drawing a
	  filled bounding box
	  behind osgText::Text. I made it so the box would get drawn using
	  whichever BackdropImplementation was selected. However, I did not
	  implement STENCIL_BUFFER. In that case it defaults to drawing the
	  bounding box using POLYGON_OFFSET instead.
	  
	  Also made it so the BOUNDINGBOX and FILLEDBOUNDINGBOX are drawn
	  with a
	  settable color and margin size.
	  
	  While I was at it I tightened up the values applied with
	  DEPTH_RANGE
	  and POLYGON_OFFSET, not just for drawing the bounding box but
	  also for
	  drawing backdrop text (these values must be coupled since the
	  bounding
	  box has to be drawn deeper in Z than the backdrop text). The
	  values
	  in use before seemed like overkill and I was seeing some
	  z-clipping
	  with my background scenery in the case of DEPTH_RANGE. If there
	  was a
	  good reason for the large values please let me know...."

2009-07-24 14:45  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, typo and comment clean ups

2009-07-24 14:45  robert

2009-07-24 12:12  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, updated CTestConfig to point to new
	  cdash.openscenegraph.org site

2009-07-23 15:25  shuber

	* updated XCode project

2009-07-23 12:42  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, Store the linkvisitor to be able to configure
	  it by user, like changing the nodemaskoverride, or use a custom
	  LinkVisitor

2009-07-17 07:47  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, "attached a modified jpeg plugin that allows
	  writing of grayscale images."

2009-07-16 12:09  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte,"When exporting some models to OpenFlight,
	  i found a crash if the texture
	  unit does not contain a TexEnv object.
	  Here's the small fix, just a test on the pointer."

2009-07-16 12:04  robert

	* From Stephan Lamoliatte, "The vertical anchor is inverted in the
	  osgWidget::Window::update function.
	  Here is a small patch to fix that."

2009-07-16 11:49  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, fix crash without error messages if the
	  example does find the nathan.osg file.

2009-07-16 11:26  robert

	* Added .get() to fix build

2009-07-16 11:21  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "These are some fixes to the mdl and bsp plugins
	  to handle transparency and lighting better, plus a few other
	  tweaks."

2009-07-16 11:06  robert

	* From Colin MacDonald,"The Optimizer Merge Geometry visitor is
	  always merging geometries,
	  even if they have had DataVariance DYNAMIC explicitly specified.
	  Then
	  when an application attempts to dynamically update the geometry
	  in the
	  frame loop the primitive sets and data arrays are no longer as
	  expected, leading to display and/or memory corruption.
	  
	  Attached is a simple fix. "
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, tweaked Colin's changes to that it use
	  != DYNAMIC as the the test rather than == STATIC.

2009-07-16 10:56  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-07-16 10:13  robert

2009-07-15 15:28  robert

	* Quitened down debug info.

2009-07-14 13:32  robert

	* Cleaned up indenting

2009-07-14 13:30  robert

	* Converted code to use osg::asciiToFloat() instead of relying
	  upong the C libraries sscanf to read floats as the C library is
	  locale sensitive.

2009-07-14 12:22  robert

	* From Alexandre Amalric, "I'm using osg svn version 2.9.5 and I've
	  apparently found a bug in osgPlugin logo.
	  
	  When using more than one view logosCullCallback function is
	  called without checking context ID from the cull visitor is equal
	  to logo _contextID variable. It involves updating logo's viewport
	  with different sizes.
	  So I made a fix well working, at least the way I use the plugin."
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, changed code to return true to signal
	  culling of logo when being applied to a window that it wasn't
	  assigned to.

2009-07-14 11:19  robert

	* Moved the getting of the ReaderWriter to do the actual model
	  loading to later so that it only gets invoked when required.

2009-07-14 11:18  robert

	* Quietened down debug messages, and added early return when
	  filename contains server address.

2009-07-14 10:37  robert

	* Refactored the setup of the reading of the wrl file by allow
	  reading from istreams, as well as nesting of filepaths using a
	  local osgDB::Options to prevent threading issues.
	  
	  Also fixed crash in parsing of the vrml data structures that
	  occurred when no vrml material was assigned.

2009-07-14 10:35  robert

	* Quitened down debug messages

2009-07-14 10:04  robert

	* Fixed the handling of compressed files

2009-07-13 16:39  robert

	* From Cory Riddel based on suggestion from Robert Osfield, "I've
	  been running with your suggested changes for a few days now and
	  it
	  has been working perfectly. I'm still not entirely clear why
	  adding a
	  slave/subgraph causes the problem."

2009-07-13 16:14  robert

	* From David Fries, "Comparing the win32 barrier to the pthread
	  barrier, win32 puts the
	  while in an else clause. When if is true the phase changes and
	  the
	  while condition will always by false, so might as well put the
	  while
	  in the else to skip the check. There's also a benefit to having
	  the
	  code logic similar between platforms.
	  "

2009-07-13 16:05  robert

	* From David Fries, "Here is a fix for a deadlock seen under
	  Windows using OpenThreads
	  Barrier operations. The error is with atomic operations in the
	  win32 condition implementation. The attached sample program will
	  reliably trigger with as few as three threads and a dual core
	  system,
	  though sometimes it will take 65,000 iterations.
	  
	  2.8.1 was the base for these changes
	  
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData.h
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData::wait does two operations to decrement
	  waiters_ then read, when InterlockedDecrement decrements and
	  returns
	  the value in one operation. The two operations allows another
	  thread
	  to also decrement with both getting 0 for an answer.
	  
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData::broadcast is using waiters_ directly
	  instead of using the w value read earlier, if it was safe to use
	  waiters_ directly there would be no need for InterlockedGet or w.
	  
	  overview of deadlock in barrier with three threads
	  one thread in broadcast, 2 threads in wait,
	  release semaphore 2, waits on waiters_done_
	  both threads wake, decrement waiters_, get 0 for w,
	  <logic error here>
	  one calls set waiters_done_,
	  broadcast thread comes out of waiters_done_,
	  other thread calls waiters_done_, (which leaves waiters_done_ in
	  the
	  signaled state)
	  <sets the trap>
	  broadcast thread returns releases mutex, other threads get
	  mutex and also return,
	  next barrier, first two threads enter wait, one goes to
	  broadcast, release
	  semaphore 2, skips waiters_done_ as it had been released last
	  time
	  returns, processes, enters the barrier for the next barrier
	  operation
	  and waits,
	  three threads are now in wait, two have the previous barrier
	  phase,
	  one the current phase, there's one count left in the semaphore
	  which a
	  thread gets, returns, enters the barrier as a waiter, sleeps, and
	  the
	  deadlock is completed"

2009-07-13 08:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "ttached you'll find a small fix for the
	  GraphicsWindowCocoa-implementation, which enhances multithreaded
	  stability, it ensures that modifications to the size of an
	  openglcontext
	  is done only from one thread.
	  "

2009-07-12 15:44  robert

	* Reverted erronous check-in (which was r10454)

2009-07-03 19:16  robert

	* Added Dragger::s/getActivationModKeyMask(..) and
	  Dragger::s/getActivationKeyEvent(...) methods to make it possible
	  to have draggers that only respond when you press a specified
	  modified key or standard key.
	  
	  Changed the optional dragger in osgvolume to require the shift
	  key to be pressed for the dragger to become active.

2009-07-03 19:07  robert

	* From and incorported the addition from Paul Fotheringham,
	  addition of define VCL_CAN_STATIC_CONST_INIT_FLOAT to be zero to
	  solve build error under Linux
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, general cleaned up ITK side to
	  CMakeList.txt.
	  
	  

2009-07-03 18:58  robert

2009-07-03 05:54  robert

	* Added callback to locator in support of interactive updating of
	  the volume extents

2009-07-03 05:52  robert

	* Added setUpGeometry to Dragger base class to make it easier to
	  use draggers interchangably.

2009-07-03 05:25  robert

	* Introduced a Locator callback and associated usage of this
	  callback to provide interactive updating of the volume bounds

2009-07-02 18:50  robert

	* Added support for a "-m" option that adds a tab box manipulator
	  to allow positioning and resizing of the rendered volume

2009-07-02 18:49  robert

	* Refactored RayTracedTechnique to allow the position of the
	  rendered part of the volume to be decoupled from the image data.

2009-07-01 15:39  robert

	* From Byran Thrall, "The OpenFlight plugin doesn't handle
	  unrecognized options or extra
	  whitespace in all cases, causing it to crash."

2009-07-01 14:50  robert

	* Removed old references to CommandManager

2009-07-01 14:49  robert

	* Added constructor and destructor body

2009-07-01 14:04  robert

	* Added osgGA to the dependency list

2009-07-01 14:01  robert

	* Completed refactor of osgManipulator, key changes are:
	  
	  Selection is now just a typedef of osg::MatrixTransform, and is
	  deprecated
	  
	  CommandManager is shell class that just sets values directly on
	  Dragger, and is deprecated
	  
	  Dragger now has list of DraggerCallback that takes over the roll
	  of tracking changes to the Dragger, and
	  allows users to track the dragger in any way they wish.
	  
	  Dragger now has a convinience method making MatrixTransforms
	  track a dragger.
	  
	  Selection and CommandManager are no longer required for use of
	  osgManipulator and are kept around for backwards compatibility.

2009-07-01 09:30  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, i miss to commit the file that contains the
	  osgAnimation::StripAnimation::traverse

2009-06-30 13:00  robert

	* Simplified Command and CommandManager

2009-06-30 12:41  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project, included
	  osgPresentation

2009-06-30 11:55  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, Traverse StripAction instead of applying,
	  this fix the execution of FrameCallback in BlendIn, BlendOut and
	  AnimationAction\nFix warning of osgAnimation::StatsHandler\nFix
	  crash when running example osganimationtimeline without
	  nathan.osg in OSG_FILE_PATH or with bad file

2009-06-30 11:39  robert

	* Refactored osgManipulator so that CommandManager is no longer
	  required, instead Dragger directly manages Constaints and
	  associate Selections.

2009-06-30 07:33  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-06-29 21:32  robert

	* Introduced event handling directly into osgManipulator::Dragger
	  to allow it be used with a global event handler passing in
	  events.

2009-06-26 16:52  robert

	* Changed the definition of HAVE_CONFIG_H so that it's only defined
	  when on a now windows system, so to allow the dcmtk/osconfig.h to
	  include the correct header on unix vs widows.

2009-06-26 16:39  robert

	* Added search in /usr/local/dicom for dcmtk.

2009-06-26 08:16  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-06-26 08:14  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-06-25 18:31  robert

	* Simplified throw rate code, and add throw rate compensation into
	  zoom in/out code.

2009-06-25 18:11  robert

	* From Lee Bulter, "I noticed that when "throwing" things the rate
	  of motion once thrown was
	  dependent on the complexity of the geometry. For complex scenes
	  this
	  meant that it looked like you were "throwing" the display into
	  molasses.
	  For simple geometry things get over-excited once thrown.
	  
	  The fix is to factor in the frame rendering time to the
	  caluclated
	  motion. I've implemented this for rotation and panning.
	  
	  Now when things are thrown they maintain a rate very close to
	  what was
	  happening when the mouse button was released."

2009-06-25 18:03  robert

	* Fixed library definition

2009-06-25 16:12  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, fixes to Cocoa support

2009-06-25 16:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "We are currently getting issues with
	  locale settings and some osg plugins.
	  Therefore I have changed all the occurances of atof by
	  asciiToFloat or
	  asciiToDouble.
	  
	  I believe that it is safe to do so at least for all the plugins.
	  Included here are also asciiToFloat conversion of environment
	  variables. One
	  might argue that these should be locale dependent. But IMO these
	  should be
	  set and interpreted by osg independent of the current locale.
	  "

2009-06-25 16:02  robert

2009-06-25 13:10  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a little fix for the FFmpeg plugin.
	  Previously the path computed by osgDB::findDataFile was not used,
	  preventing loading files from directories inside the data path
	  list."

2009-06-25 13:00  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "please find attached some typo fixes in
	  DatabasePager and a tweak to only print the
	  addLoadedDataToSceneGraph stats when some work was actually
	  done."

2009-06-25 09:14  robert

	* From Cory Riddell, "I added an _allowThrow boolean along with a
	  getter and setter to the
	  spherical manipulator. The default value is true.
	  
	  This is very similar to the flag in trackball."

	* Added support for initial cut of static build of Present3D.

2009-06-20 11:35  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I found a bug in the osgText library in
	  version 1.2 that I believe still exists in the latest version.
	  
	  I found that changing the alignment of a text object does not
	  work properly if the text contains newline characters. I've
	  attached a simple test case that shows the problem. If I set the
	  text AFTER setting the alignment, everything works fine. But if I
	  set the text BEFORE setting the alignment then the text is
	  displayed incorrectly.
	  
	  The fix is very simple. Instead of calling computePositions() in
	  TextBase::setAlignment(), it calls computeGlyphRepresentation().
	  I've attached the modified TextBase.cpp."

2009-06-20 08:18  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-06-19 14:14  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "AFAICS, OSG's OBJ loader correctly
	  handles backslash-newlines that are used for continuation of
	  lines. However, I recently ran into a problem with OBJs that
	  where converted from another source using Right Hemisphere Deep
	  Exploration. In these OBJs newlines are escaped in the following
	  way:
	  
	  f 15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178 15940/10001/16179\
	  15938/10002/16180
	  
	  In the OBJ loader the newline would be interpreted as follows
	  
	  f 15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178
	  15940/10001/1617915938/10002/16180
	  
	  However, for correctly loading the model it should be interpreted
	  as
	  
	  f 15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178 15940/10001/16179
	  15938/10002/16180
	  
	  Thus, the escaped newline should be interpreted as a space.
	  
	  I tried to lookup what the correct interpretation for a
	  backslash-newline was in the OBJ spec but did not find anything
	  useful. Nevertheless, my suggestion would be to adopt replacing
	  the escaped newline by a space in order to avoid problems as
	  stated above. I cannot imagine a meaningful usage of a newline
	  within a numerical literal so I do not foresee cases where
	  replacing a backslash-newline by a space would be harmful. The
	  fixed obj.cpp is zipped and attached to this mail."

2009-06-19 13:53  robert

	* Changed the debug output so that the code path is not run unless
	  it's needed

2009-06-19 13:50  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastian Guay and Robert Osfield, added line numbers
	  to debug shader output

2009-06-19 13:09  robert

	* From Tom Jolly, "A new compiler and a new warning.
	  
	  Enclosed is include/osgParticle/Particle. I removed the const
	  from the
	  return type of getSTexCoord. I also changed the name on the next
	  function to getTTexCoord so it is consistent with getSTexCoord.
	  If you
	  prefer to change getSTexCoord to getSCoord you will need to
	  change it in
	  ConnectedParticleSystem.cpp."

2009-06-19 11:55  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Here are my changes:
	  
	  - osg::Texture sets GL_MAX_TEXTURE_LEVEL if image uses fewer
	  mipmaps than
	  number from computeNumberOfMipmaps (and it works!)
	  - DDS fix to read only available mipmaps
	  - DDS fixes to read / save 3D textures with mipmaps ( packing ==
	  1 is
	  required)
	  - Few cosmetic DDS modifications and comments to make code
	  cleaner (I hope)
	  
	  Added _isTextureMaxLevelSupported variable to texture extensions.
	  It
	  could be removed if OSG requires OpenGL version 1.2 by default.
	  
	  Added simple ComputeImageSizeInBytes function in DDSReaderWrites.
	  In
	  my opinion it would be better if similar static method was
	  defined for
	  Image. Then it could be used not only in DDS but other modules as
	  well (I
	  noticed that Texture/Texture2D do similar computations).
	  
	  Also attached is an example test.osg model with DDS without last
	  mipmaps to
	  demonstrate the problem. When loaded into Viewer with current
	  code and moved
	  far away, so that cube occupies 4 pixels, cube becomes red due to
	  the issue
	  I described in earlier post. When you patch DDS reader writer
	  with attched
	  code but no osg::Texture yet, cube becomes blank (at least on my
	  Windows/NVidia) When you also merge osg::Texture patch cube will
	  look right
	  and mipmaps will be correct."

2009-06-19 11:31  robert

2009-06-19 10:55  robert

	* From Cory Riddell, "I added a line to clear the threads vector
	  prior to populating it in
	  Viewer::getAllThreads(). This is consistent with what happens in
	  Viewer::getOperationThreads()."

2009-06-18 10:01  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson and Robert Osfield, addition of NodeCallbacks
	  to osg::CopyOp and osg::Node copy constructor.

2009-06-18 08:18  robert

	* From Rene Molenaar, "The bug is as described above:
	  
	  "The dragger's corner tabs are no longer in the corners."
	  
	  this fix places the cornertabs back in the corners.
	  (the manipulator does not make sense otherwise)."

2009-06-17 16:54  robert

	* Made method names consistent with each other

2009-06-17 11:00  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "the new changes in osgAnimation showed some
	  errors on the Cygwin
	  platform:
	  
	  1 - osgAnimation/StatsHandler includes <cmath>, but on Cygwin
	  only std::isnan
	  is defined that way. I changed it to <math.h> as it is done in
	  the rest of
	  the OSG.
	  
	  2 - Pulling some osgViewer headers from the same file in
	  osgAnimation makes
	  the former a new dependency. Thus, I got errors at osgAnimation
	  linking time.
	  I wonder why nobody noticed this on other platforms. I have
	  updated the
	  CMakeLists.txt file in order to link to the needed libraries, and
	  
	  3 - I have updated the openscenegraph-osgAnimation.pc.in file
	  accordingly."

2009-06-17 10:39  robert

	* Changed build OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION to ON

	  cleanup and add a statshandler to visualize current action in
	  timeline

2009-06-14 23:30  cedricpinson

	* From Cedric Pinson, fix copy constructor for clone operation for
	  Bone, add a missing contructor with quaternion for Target

2009-06-12 10:37  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-06-12 10:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "attached is a change to the ProxyNode
	  that also includes ProxyNode local
	  database options like recently added to PagedLOD.
	  
	  Also there is a change to the traverse method:
	  The previous ProxyNode checks the VisitorType to be a
	  CULL_VISITOR and the
	  presence of a request handler to submit a database request.
	  In contrast to that PagedLOD uses the request handler if it is
	  there - even if
	  the visitor type is not a cull visitor.
	  The change removes the cull visitor test from the ProxyNode so
	  that it behaves
	  like the PagedLOD.
	  I believe that the presence of a request handler in a visitor
	  might be
	  sufficient to trigger the requests as this is done in the
	  PagedLOD anyway.
	  
	  Based on rev 10332."

2009-06-12 10:00  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "here are some small fixes/enahncements for
	  the cocoa backend to allow
	  proper functioning when running the osgViewer run-loop in a
	  secondary
	  thread (e.g. when embedding GraphicsWindowCocoa-windows in a full
	  blown
	  cocoa application).
	  
	  OS X is picky when you want to change the user-interface from
	  another
	  thread than the main thread, not all UI stuff is thread-safe. So
	  now
	  window closes and showing / hiding the menu bar is done in the
	  main
	  thread via Cocoa's performSelectorOnMainThread-mechanism.
	  
	  These changes don't affect the normal osgViewer usage pattern."

2009-06-12 09:57  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "there seems to be a bug in the proxynode
	  writer introduced in svn rev 10330. It craches on a null pointer
	  for options (on my windows system).
	  Fixed version of the file "src\osgPlugins\osg\ProxyNode.cpp"
	  attached, based on svn rev 10332."

2009-06-12 09:48  robert

	* From Konstantin Sinitsyn, "I've fixed bug with loading of

2009-06-12 09:41  robert

	* From Roger James and Robert Osfield, clean up of COLLADA CMake

2009-06-12 09:11  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2009-06-11 15:13  robert

	* Fixed copy constructor

2009-06-11 14:56  robert

	* Replaced frame delta computation that was originally based on a
	  local static variable, replacing it with member variable to
	  tracking the previous frame time. This fixes a bug in the wind
	  computation when multiple PrecipitaionEffects are in the scene.

2009-06-10 09:24  robert

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I've updated the CURL plugin to support the
	  CURL_CONNECTTIMEOUT and CURL_TIMEOUT options.
	  
	  Those two additional options can now be set using the
	  Options::setOptionsString() function (just like the already
	  existing OSG_CURL_PROXY & OSG_CURL_PROXYPORT options).
	  
	  This is a convient solution to limit the freezing effect one may
	  face in case the targeted server is down or too slow.
	  
	  I successfully compiled and used this updated version on Windows
	  in my application.
	  
	  And by default those settings are not set (so no change in the
	  behavior if you don't need them).
	  "

2009-06-09 08:43  robert

	* From Gustav Happalahti, fixed filename usage

2009-06-08 16:50  robert

	* From Gustav Haapalahti and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  First Submission email from Gustav:
	  "This submission adds a --cache option to osgconv and osgviewer
	  that enables setObjectCacheHint(osgDB::Options::CACHE_ALL); It
	  greatly reduces memory usage when a .osg file has lots of
	  external references with ProxyNode:s that points to the same
	  file.
	  
	  Options are also added to the osg plugin. The code was already
	  mostly implemented but there was no way to change the options.
	  includeExternalReferences
	  writeExternalReferenceFiles
	  A counter is added to keep track if an external file has already
	  been written down to avoid writing the same file over and over
	  again. If it has already been written once then it is not written
	  again.
	  The counter is added to the Output class in osgDB.
	  "
	  
	  Second Submission email from Gustav:
	  "This is a continuation to my previous submission.
	  I noticed that the same problem that I fixed in ProxyNode.cpp for
	  the osg plugin (external files being written over and over again)
	  also existed in the ive plugin. I attached a submission where the
	  ive plugin remembers which external files that have already been
	  written and do not write them again."
	  
	  
	  Changes to the above done by Robert Osfield,
	  
	  changed command line parameter to --enable-object-cache
	  changed set/get methods in osgDB::Output and
	  ive/DataOutputStream.cpp to be s/getExternalFileWritten(const
	  std::string&)
	  cleaned up set up of osgDB::Options.

2009-06-08 14:06  robert

	* Martin Beckett, "Here's a first attempt at a DXF writer plugin
	  
	  At the moment it outputs DXF for whatever geometry is contained
	  in the node it would be nice to draw the model as it is rendered
	  (points/lines/surface)
	  
	  If people could also test against other apps that need to read
	  DXF, the format is a bit of a black art and not all importers
	  support all features so it might need some options to tweak the
	  output.
	  
	  It has some rather clever colour lookup stuff to match real
	  colours against the limited DXF palette. I cracked the code of
	  the Autocad indexed colours!"

2009-06-08 13:51  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Without this change packed depth stencil
	  attachments are only supported if the
	  GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit extension is available. This is due to
	  the early
	  return from the constructor if this is missing.
	  As far as I read the standard extension documents, this blit call
	  is not
	  required to have packed depth stencil fbos.
	  The change fixes this and allows packed stencil attachments on
	  machines
	  without the multisample blit command."

2009-06-08 13:47  robert

	* Addded .ive and .osg support for new
	  GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate properties in osg::BlendEquation

2009-06-08 13:46  robert

	* From Konstantin Sinitsyn, support for
	  GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate extension like in
	  osg::BlendEquation.

2009-06-08 12:50  robert

	* Added basic Matrix::decompose() test, based on a test progrem

2009-06-08 12:44  robert

	* Fixed doc message

2009-06-08 11:12  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "this correction makes the intensity

2009-06-08 10:54  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-06-08 10:27  robert

	* Changed the file search path so it returns an empty string when
	  the filename contains a server address.

2009-06-08 09:47  robert

	* From Johan Nouvel, fix to handling of transparent textured
	  objects.
	  
	  Tweak from Robert Osfield, commented out disabling of depth write
	  as this is not appropriate by default.

2009-06-05 19:05  robert

	* Added collateReferencesToDependentCameras() and
	  clearReferencesToDependentCameras() methods into RenderStage and
	  SceneView, and use
	  of these methods in src/osgViewer/Renderer.cpp to make sure that
	  the draw thread keeps references to all in scene graph Cameras
	  that are being used by the drawing threads, to keep the Camera's
	  alive even when the main thread removes these Cameras from the
	  scene graph.

2009-06-05 11:48  robert

	* Added depends_on template and usage in RenderBin to help with

2009-06-02 08:53  robert

	* Moved assigned of texture object to _textureObjectBuffer to
	  earlier in Texture2D::apply() to prevent problems with non power
	  of two texture mipmap generation.

2009-06-01 11:22  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, Fixed handling of empty Program.

2009-06-01 11:08  robert

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I've also updated the computeBound() method
	  from the osg::Transform class : this method was using float based
	  temporary variables and thus the double precision is lost here.
	  I've changed that to use the generic types
	  osg::BoundingSphere::vec_type and osg::BoundingSphere::value_type
	  instead."

2009-06-01 11:07  robert

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I'm joining an updated version of the file
	  daeWritter.cpp and daeWriter.h for the collada plugin compatible
	  with the usage of double precision BoundingSphere & BoundingBox.
	  The only change is the addition of the template specialization
	  for osg::Vec3d object (until now only the specialization for
	  osg::Vec3 was defined, I replaced that with osg::Vec3f to be more
	  "precise")."

2009-05-30 07:39  robert

	  with certain key-strokes, which led to a crash."

2009-05-28 13:40  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I suppose this error is caused by
	  using 4 component tex coord in texture2D call. I always forget
	  about adding .xy swizzle at the end of tex coord. I have attached
	  code (hopefully fixed). My NVidia seems to ignore such errors.
	  Cannot test it myself. Simple example works because I actually
	  use textture2Dproj there."

2009-05-28 13:29  robert

	* From Gregory Jaegy and Robert Osfield, added support for static
	  linking of OpenFlight plugin

2009-05-28 13:26  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2009-05-28 12:25  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "Two changes here...
	  
	  1. I've implemented an option controlled route by which users can
	  still access the old method of extracting the zip content to the
	  local filesystem. This is in response to Ulrich's comments about
	  zip files encorporating files other than those that OSG knows
	  about, but which an application may require.
	  
	  To access this the user makes the following call on their options
	  object that they pass to the reader. Without it, the plugin will
	  extract by default to memory.
	  
	  local_opt->setPluginStrData("zipextract","filesystem");
	  
	  
	  2. The second change is that I've moved the declaration of one of
	  the variables to within the numitems loop so that if loading of a
	  specific file within the zip fails, subsequent files still load
	  correctly. This was the issue that Ulrich raised."

2009-05-28 08:25  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-05-27 13:02  robert

	* Renamed application osgvirtualprogram to osgshadercompostior to

	  traversed in.

2009-05-27 09:45  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-05-26 14:22  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching the updated VRML plugin, as
	  promised. This version works
	  with OpenVRML 0.17.12 and Boost 1.38. Other versions may work
	  too, but I
	  didn't test that."

2009-05-26 11:00  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "please find a patch for the DirectX loader
	  to use std::istreams. This will make it usable with the zip
	  plugin."

2009-05-26 10:10  robert

	* Fixed warnings

2009-05-25 16:34  robert

	* Refactored the GraphicsWindowX11::adaptKey() implementation so
	  that it always uses the reampX11Key(ks) method, and for the
	  mapping to handle case correctly.

2009-05-25 13:02  robert

2009-05-25 11:16  robert

	* Added initializer of ParticleSystemUpdater::_frameNumber

2009-05-25 11:12  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Two fixes for LUMINANCE and
	  ALPHA_LUMINACE pixel formats written into DDS file. Component
	  masks were incorrect. I tested results with ultimate DDS
	  compatibitlity tester ie Microsoft DirectX Texture tool ;-). I
	  have also added comment with warning about possible problems when
	  writing other than 8 bit component pixel formats.
	  "

2009-05-25 10:46  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The latest osg::notify is crashing at
	  initialisation on Solaris, due to
	  constructor issues:
	  
	  Within the NullStream & NotifyStream classes the base class
	  objects
	  (ostream) were being initialised before the class member _buffer
	  objects
	  which they referenced, causing a crash.
	  
	  I had to move the file scope g_NullStream & g_NotifyStream
	  initialisation
	  into a function to get them to work.
	  
	  Also there was a missing osg:: qualifier on getNotifyHandler."

2009-05-22 08:31  robert

	* From Alberto Luacas, added new pkg-cofig files

2009-05-22 07:52  robert

	* From Alberto Luacas, separate pkg-config .pc files

2009-05-21 16:33  robert

	* Fixed handling of case where the master and the slave camera are
	  placed on the same GraphisContext, or when the master camera and
	  slave camera are assigned to different Camers. Note normally one
	  doesn't mix master with GraphicsContexts and slave cameras so
	  neither case is common.

2009-05-21 08:37  robert

	* Changed TerrainManipulator to use HEADING rather than AZIM to
	  keep it consistent with SphericalManipulator

2009-05-20 10:58  robert

	* Converted SphericalManipulator to use Elevation and Heading
	  rather than Zenith and Azimuth.

2009-05-19 16:12  shuber

	* updated XCode-project

2009-05-19 15:11  robert

	* Fixed typo

2009-05-19 15:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-05-19 14:03  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "In MatrixManipulator can we have
	  computeHomePosition() use _homeUp rather than the hardcoded
	  (0,0,1).
	  This makes it possible to redefine the viewing direction of
	  'home' in the other manipulator - so home in a GIS app could be a
	  plan view.
	  Since _homeUp is set to (0,0,1) and no current code changes it
	  there shouldn't be any difference for current users."

2009-05-19 12:25  robert

	* Attempt to fix Cygwin build failure

2009-05-19 12:21  robert

	* Changed the default home position so that it's consistent with
	  other OSG manipulators. Added setter of properties of the
	  SphericalManipualtor, moved across to using doubles internally

2009-05-19 11:18  robert

	* From Mojtaba Fathi, "I've developed a new manipulator which uses
	  azimuth and zenith angles to rotate scene and so avoids Roll
	  angle rotation, such that scene is always seen as Z upward."

2009-05-19 10:45  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "when using windownames and switching between
	  fullscreen and windowed
	  mode GraphicsWindowCocoa crashes. Attached you'll find a fix for
	  that bug.
	  "

2009-05-19 10:42  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, replaced #include <malloc.h> with #include
	  <stdlib.h> to fix build under OSX

2009-05-19 10:35  shuber

	* updated XCode-project

2009-05-19 09:26  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, intergrated support for uncompressing zip files
	  in memory and from istreams (enabling reading from http).

2009-05-18 15:46  robert

	* Added enable of clear stencil and depth mask to ensure that
	  stencil and depth buffers are always cleared when required

2009-05-18 15:21  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, "Attached you will find some changes to the
	  dae plugin to improve light support.
	  
	  -Changed the addition of lights to add the lightsource directly
	  into the scenegraph (instead of below a switch node)
	  -All added lights are enabled in the root stateset and replace
	  the head- or skylight.
	  (if no lights are available the head- or skylight will remain
	  active)
	  -Ambient in osg::LightModel is zeroed out. All ambient now comes
	  from separate ambient only light sources.
	  -Lights can now be written properly
	  -Replaced strings by constants defined in the Collada DOM"

2009-05-18 13:01  robert

	* Quietened down debug messages

2009-05-18 12:54  robert

	* From Ross Anderson, "Symptom: The computation of TerrainTiles
	  containing only image layers (no elevation layer) is incorrect.
	  The resulting bounding sphere will always have a radius of zero.
	  
	  The fix is to remove the call to bs.expandBy(v) and compute the
	  radius directly. I believe this call was intended to be
	  bs.expandRadiusBy(v), but it is superfluous when the radius is
	  computed directly."

2009-05-18 12:04  robert

	* From Maciej Krol,"With advent of GUI applications in OSG there is
	  a growing need to redirect notification messages to third party
	  systems. For example windows applications do not have console
	  output, it would be appropriate to redirect notifications to GUI
	  widget or debug output. I have revamped notification system to
	  fit this need. New notification stream is using NotifyHandler as
	  a message sink. Handler is called whenever stream is synchronized
	  (i.e. after <<std::endl). Standard streams std::cout and
	  std::cerr are no longer used although by default
	  StandardNotifyHandler is a message sink. Custom notification
	  handler can be set with osg::setNotifyHandler(NotifyHandler *)
	  function.
	  
	  Two implementations of NotifyHandler are currently available:
	  - StandardNotifyHandler, calls fputs(message, stderr) for
	  severity <= WARN and fputs(message, stdout) for severity > WARN
	  - WinDebugNotifyHandler, windows users can redirect notifications
	  to windows debug output, notifications can be viewed in output
	  window of the debugger i.e. MSVC or DebugView
	  (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx)
	  (see screenshot).
	  
	  I have seen on osg-users that some people do
	  std::cerr.rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf()) to redirect notifications.
	  This trick will no longer work since osg::notify() returns
	  internal osg::NotifyStream not std::cout or std::cerr. You can
	  use osg::notify().rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf()) to do this instead.
	  
	  Additionally I've made some minor fixes:
	  - Minor imrovements to osg::notify documentation
	  - NullStream could crash by deleting stream buffer other than
	  default NullStreamBuffer in the destructor i.e. after
	  osg::notify(osg::DEBUG_FP).rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf())"

2009-05-18 10:37  robert

	* From Paul Obermeier, "Please find enclosed some changed OSG
	  header files.
	  The changes are more or less just beautifications
	  (when looked at them from the C++ view), but make
	  wrapping OSG with SWIG easier.
	  I have tested the changes with both 2.8.1-rc4 and the
	  current head and would appreciate to incorporate the
	  changes in both branches.
	  
	  Here is a description of the changes:
	  
	  osg/BoundingSphere:
	  Use the following typedef (like used in BoundingBox)
	  typedef typename VT::value_type value_type;
	  instead of
	  typedef typename vec_type::value_type value_type;
	  
	  SWIG reports errors on the latter construct.
	  Also makes it consistent with BoundingBox.
	  
	  
	  osg/Vec4ub:
	  Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the file.
	  
	  
	  osg/Vec?b:
	  Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the files.
	  
	  Also changed
	  typedef char value_type;
	  to
	  typedef signed char value_type;
	  
	  In the case of a simple "char", SWIG assumes a string.
	  Using "signed char" instead of "char" does not change
	  the behaviour of the class.
	  "

2009-05-18 10:28  robert

	* Minor tweaks to avoid warnings when generating wrappers/doxygen
	  documentation

2009-05-18 10:17  robert

	  under RedHat 3.2.
	  
	  Removed redundant version declarations.

2009-05-15 07:50  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "n bool ReaderWriter::fileExists(const
	  std::string& filename, const Options* /*options*/) const
	  
	  Windows doesn't define F_OK and access() is in io.h, rather than
	  stdio.h
	  These are fixed in FileUtils.cpp, so I copied the fix from there
	  - might be better to move this to FileUtils header and include it
	  here and in FileUtils.cpp?"

2009-05-14 16:24  robert

	* Moved the compilation of Contributors list to separate source
	  file, and made it an optional compile based on whether you are a
	  maintainer or not.

2009-05-14 16:08  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "please find attached a patch for
	  TrackballManipulator to fix zooming using the MBP touchpad. The
	  old code would always zoom-in even when using the gesture to
	  zoom-out.
	  
	  Also attached are some code and documentation cleanups for
	  GUIEventAdapter that collect related values (e.g. scrolling,
	  tablet pen) in a struct.
	  "

2009-05-14 16:06  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find some bugfixes and
	  enhancements for the Cocoa
	  implementation of GraoicsWindowCocoa:
	  
	  Enhancements/Bugfixes:
	  
	  + now it's possible to integrate osgViewer better into existing
	  cocoa-applications:
	  * create one or more NSOpenGLView(s) and add these to your
	  window(s)
	  * create one or more NSWindows
	  * disable the integrated event-polling of osgViewer, and let the
	  work be
	  done by Cocoa / NSApplicationRun. You'll have to run the
	  osgViewer's
	  runloop in a separate thread
	  
	  + missing menu-event-handling implemented
	  
	  + added NSAutoReleasePools where necessary, this fixes some

	  + fixed some crashes and thread-issues"

2009-05-14 13:40  robert

	* Integrated support for relative paths, and http hosted
	  presentations

	* Added support for reading presentations and content via http,
	  with support of the FileCache when available.

2009-05-13 19:47  robert

	* Added intial cut at fileExists() implement using libcurl. Note,
	  current implement loads the whole file and then discards it so is
	  very in-efficient. This implementation will soon be replaced.

2009-05-13 19:46  robert

	* Added ReaderWriter::fileExists() method to help enable querrying
	  of existing of files on servers using the curl plugin

	* Rearranged static SDL callback so that it's after the SDL.h
	  header.

2009-05-13 08:33  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "On Windows, when a process tries to
	  spawn one too many thread,
	  _beginthreadex() fails but OpenThreads still waits on the startup
	  Block before returning to the caller of
	  OpenThreads::Thread::start().
	  This causes a deadlock. The return value of _beginthreadex() is
	  actually checked, but after the call to
	  OpenThreads::Block::block() so
	  it is basically useless.
	  
	  Attached is a fix to move the check for the return value of
	  _beginthreadex() before the call to block(), so that start() can
	  return to the caller with a non-zero error code. This solves the
	  problem for me."

2009-05-12 16:26  robert

	* Removed SDL header

2009-05-12 13:24  robert

2009-05-11 13:03  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber:
	  updated XCode project to reflect current trunk

2009-05-11 11:39  robert

	* Moved Registry::ReadFileCallback + WriteFileCallback, and
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options into their own separate Options file
	  and into the osgDB namespace.
	  
	  Introduced a new callback osgDB::FindFileCallback that overrides
	  the default behavior of findDataFile/findLibraryFile.
	  
	  Introduced support for assigning ReaderWriter::Options directory
	  to PagedLOD.
	  
	  Introduced new osgDB::FileLocationCallback for assistancing the
	  DatabasePager to know when a file is hosted on a local or remote
	  file system.

2009-05-11 11:08  robert

	* Added OSG_MIN_VERSION_REQUIRED, OSG_VERSION_LESS_THAN,
	  OSG_VERSION_LESS_OR_EQUAL, OSG_VERSION_GREATER_THAN,
	  OSG_VERSION_GREATER_OR_EQUAL macros to help out with management

2009-05-09 08:54  robert

	* Moved Options copy constructor to .cpp

2009-05-09 08:49  robert

	* Refactored the Registry::ReadFileCallback, WriteFileCallback and
	  ReaderWriter::Options to they are now defined in their own header
	  and in the osgDB namespace.
	  
	  Introduced a new FindFileCallback to Registry to compliement the
	  existing ReadFileCallback and WriteFileCallback.
	  
	  Added support for assign Find, Read and WriteFileCallbacks to
	  osdDB::Options to enable plugins/applications to override the
	  callbacks just for that
	  read/write call and any nested file operations

2009-05-08 12:53  robert

	* Removed redudent check against frustum.getCurrentMask()

2009-05-07 13:30  robert

	* From Frederic Bouvier, SetCursor fixes from GraphicsWindowWin32,
	  
	  Original email from Frederic at start of thread:
	  "he patch attached, made from r10068, fix two things, in other of
	  importance :
	  
	  - the selected cursor is never shown ( second change in file ).
	  Only the left arrow is always displayed.
	  - remove the arbitrary ( in my sense ) limitation that the user
	  cannot choose a cursor with the same shape that one used when
	  resizing the window. This limitation doesn't exist for X11, and
	  we have a diverging behaviour there ( first change in file ).
	  Flightgear use the LeftRightCursor in look around mode."
	  
	  Follow up email from Frederic (with changes that finally made it
	  into this check in:
	  "I've just tested Mark's suggestion and it works perfectly, even
	  when the
	  cursor goes to the border then come back inside the window.
	  But his patch doesn't seem to be based on the last revision of
	  the
	  files, or at least not on the trunk, and there are more changes
	  than
	  expected in them, including some loss from the previous patches.
	  The patch attached is based on r10068 of
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp and r10067 of
	  include/osgViewer/api/Win32/GraphicsWindowWin32"

2009-05-07 13:23  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "while debugging a problem in finding plugins
	  on OS X I discovered, that
	  the conditional directives for setting the prepend-string in
	  createLibraryNameForExtension were not in effect, because of the
	  mixture
	  of different #ifdef styles.
	  
	  I removed the conditional part for __APPLE__ completely to be
	  more
	  standard-conform with other platforms (plugins should be located
	  in
	  osgPlugins-X.X.X/). Because of the wrong syntax of the
	  conditional
	  compile the old code was not used anyway -- so no functional
	  change.
	  "

2009-05-07 13:21  robert

	* From MAthias Froehlich, "Attached is a compile fix I need on Suse
	  11.1 for a successful compile.
	  Just avoid uint8_t typed values in

2009-05-07 13:15  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "For me, on Windows, I also get a slew of
	  these warnings when I move the window off screen.
	  So, might be a bit fiddly to try and prevent frame update in all
	  situations that SwapBuffers retuns false.
	  I wondered if we could address this issue by only reporting the
	  error if GetLastError is also non zero. Works for me!
	  The value returned by GetLastError is zero when SwapBuffers is
	  called for a minimized or off screen window, so we could just add
	  a check for this.
	  Just say the word, and I'll post my modified
	  GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp to the submissions list. ;-)
	  Cheers.
	  Chris.

2009-05-01 08:49  robert

	* From Michael Platings, compile fix for the following problem
	  report on osg-users:
	  
	  "the latest SVN revision cannot be build under Windows if
	  ?OSG_USE_UTF8_FILENAME? config option is enabled. The error
	  occurs in ?FileUtils.cpp? file, line 663, since there is no
	  UNICODE-capable version of the ?GetProcAddress? function. The
	  ?OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING? makro is defined as follows in that
	  case
	  
	  
	  
	  #define OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING(x) L ## #x L"W"
	  
	  
	  
	  Thus the second parameter cannot be converted from wchar_t to
	  LPCSTR. Should we convert the second parameter from wchar_t* to
	  LPCSTR or use the same definition for the
	  ?OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING? makro in both cases?
	  
	  
	  
	  The second error occurs in the same file, line 669. The second
	  parameter for the ?pGetModuleHandleEx? function should be defined
	  as wchar_t, but it?s defined as ?static char static_variable? in
	  the line 667."

2009-04-24 11:01  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "change adds some code to also print the
	  NodePath when a NaN is
	  detected in the CullVisitor.
	  May be this gives a bit more of a hint when this happens."

2009-04-24 10:54  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "Currently, the .mdl plugin loads vertices in
	  the native DirectX order, which is the reverse of OpenGL order.
	  This means that the back faces are currently rendered as front
	  faces, and vice versa.
	  
	  This fix reverses the vertex order and sets up proper OpenGL
	  facing. I didn't notice this problem until I started using the
	  plug-in in my own code (osgviewer seems to not enable backface
	  culling)."

2009-04-24 09:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Changed osg::TextureRectangle to use
	  osg::Texutre::applyTexParameters() to take advantage of texture
	  shadow extension settings for texture rectangle

2009-04-23 13:42  robert

	* Warning fixes

2009-04-23 10:24  robert

	* Refactored the subsurface PolygonOffset code so that it uses
	  sensible values and also moves management of the PolygonOffset
	  and Depth attribute objects into the Document object rather than
	  using static vars.

2009-04-23 10:23  robert

	* Removed specific ATI path in PolygonOffset as it doesn't look to
	  be neccessary with present ATI hardware/drivers

	  libcurl plugin).
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, ammendments of the above to better support
	  reading of files from local directories.

2009-04-22 13:50  robert

	* From Erik den Dekker, "I revamped osgversion, which resulted (I
	  think) in cleaner code. The only functional change was giving my
	  brother the original credits he deserved. Name changed from
	  'Jeoen den Dekker' to 'Jeroen den Dekker'."

2009-04-22 13:09  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "fix for failing collada builds on osx due to

	  included."

2009-04-22 13:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "attached is a change to TexGenNode rev

2009-04-22 11:20  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "Please find attached two files that I've
	  amended to add the IDC_HAND cursor for the windows platform."

2009-04-22 11:12  robert

	* From Peter Amstutz, "Here is a simple change to
	  osgViewer::GraphicsWindowWin32 to add a flag to WindowData to
	  specify that the graphics window should not install an event
	  handler of its own, per this discussion thread:
	  
	  http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-users@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg23734.html
	  
	  The change is source compatible with current osg code and will
	  not affect current users, it simply adds an additional parameter
	  to the GraphicsWindowWin32::WindowData struct constructor and
	  defaults to the current behavior.
	  
	  Attached are the files
	  "include/osgViewer/api/Win32/GraphicsWindowWin32" and
	  "src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp" with my changes, based on
	  svn revision 10045. In addition, I have provided an svn patch
	  file with the same changes for your convenience.
	  
	  I have discussed the matter with my supervisor, and agreed that
	  my company makes no copyright claim over this extremely trivial
	  change (or to put it another way, we assign copyright to the open
	  scene graph community.)"

2009-04-22 11:00  robert

	* From Eduardo Alberto Hernández Muñoz, change to using TexGenNode
	  for setting up tex coordinates

2009-04-22 10:54  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Looks like the people who created these two
	  examples were a bit careless with cut and paste."

2009-04-22 10:47  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "src/osg/Image.cpp is missing the GL_RGBA8
	  image type when calculating the number of components in an image.
	  It is added here."

2009-04-22 10:46  robert

	* Changed parameter for T* to const T*.

2009-04-21 14:27  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I found that the current CMakeLists.txt
	  doesn't set the debugging flags correctly on OSX when using cmake
	  to generate Xcode projects. This change has the potential to
	  affect all platforms, so it should be tested."

2009-04-21 14:15  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "here is an update to ReaderWriterCurl that
	  makes use of the amended ReaderWriter definition to pass some
	  plugin string data via the options object."

2009-04-21 12:02  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-04-21 11:48  robert

	  under mingw

2009-04-13 09:35  robert

	* From Santosh Gaikwad, "I have added the exception handling in ply
	  loader. All exceptions I am catching in VertexData::readPlyFile()
	  and made sure that application will not crash or exit if any
	  exception occurred. I am returning NULL from
	  VertexData::readPlyFile() if any exception occurred.
	  "

2009-04-12 18:54  robert

2009-04-10 09:56  robert

	* From Romain Charbit, "added a getConnectedSelections(Dragger&)
	  method, so we can get which selections are connected to a dragger
	  without make our own multimap, copying the existing
	  _draggerSelectionMap (which is protected with no accessors) ."

2009-04-10 09:37  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, tweak to fix spelling and grammer

2009-04-10 09:16  robert

	* From Santosh Gaikwad, warning fixes

2009-04-09 18:27  robert

	* Added ply entry

2009-04-09 18:26  robert

	* From Santosh Gaikwad, ply plugin, based on Equalizer and other
	  LGPL compatible sources.
	  
	  "Attached is the osg-plugin for reading ply ( Stanford Triangle
	  Format ) file. I have written the plugin according to OSG
	  standard and have also added cmake build system. The plugin is
	  working fine on both Linux and Windows and should behave
	  similarly on other OS as well."
	  
	  "I developed this plugin while working on a project based on
	  Equalizer. So VertexData which I am using is taken from equalizer
	  and modified to make them work as separate OSG plugin.
	  Before contributing this plugin to OSG community, I asked project
	  manager of Equalizer project Stefen regarding potential licensing
	  issues and this is what he has said
	  
	  "The kd-Tree (VertexBuffer*) is LGPL-licensed, and the base ply
	  loader (ply*) is BSD. As long as you leave the copyright notices
	  intact, there is no issue."
	  
	  so I think using these files in OSG should not be a problem.
	  
	  As far as author of ReaderWriterPLY.cpp is concerned I am the
	  author. I am working for Darshan3d which is a subsidiary of
	  VizExperts thats why I have put VizExperts copyright."

2009-04-09 16:40  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber:
	  updated XCode project to reflect current trunk

2009-04-09 16:31  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "I have fixed up the 3DC reader to handle
	  any field separator so it can read x,y,z files and added ability
	  to write a 3DC file."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, refactor of the above code to retain a bit
	  more of the original funcionality, and to avoid the need to hand
	  maintained XCode projects from being updated.

2009-04-09 15:56  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, ""
	  * Use the CPack ZIP generator on windows (WIN32)
	  * Reformatted according to Philip Lowman's recent submissions"

2009-04-09 15:55  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-04-09 15:34  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a small fix for
	  PixelBufferCarbon preventing it to
	  be compiled for 64bit. This is the easiest solution for the old
	  deprecated xcode project."

2009-04-09 15:33  robert

	* Converted tabs to four spaces

2009-04-09 14:41  robert

	* From Paul Martz, typo fix

2009-04-09 14:38  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When creating a cylinder without a
	  bottom or a top (in the traits, createBottom=false and
	  createTop=false), the cylinder could still be picked by picking
	  its (non-existent) bottom or top. This is because the
	  PrimitiveShapeFunctor does not consider the traits when returning
	  the cylinder's geometry for the picking test, and always returns
	  geometry for the whole cylinder, with bottom, top and body.
	  
	  I have attached a fixed file where the traits are checked in the
	  PrimitiveShapeFunctor where appropriate. They are checked for
	  Box, Cone Capsule and Cylinder. These just mirror the checks that
	  were already done in the DrawShapeVisitor.
	  
	  (another instance where if the ShapeDrawable had just been
	  osg::Geometry, there wouldn't have been a problem... :-) )
	  
	  I also fixed a small typo in the file in two places
	  ("implementated" --> "implemented")."

2009-04-09 14:31  robert

	* From Cory Riddell, "I added an _allowThrow bool and get / set
	  accessors to
	  TrackballManipulator. The purpose of this is to disable throwing
	  when
	  you release the mouse button while moving the mouse. The default
	  settings is true (ie, allow throw). The two source files are
	  attached.
	  "

2009-04-09 14:25  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, "OK I have been away for a looong time, but
	  still occasionally watching from a distance, and saw the bug
	  people have reported about the DepthPartitionNode not handling
	  scaled models properly.
	  
	  I believe this is now fixed ... I have attached the new
	  DistanceAccumulator.cpp, along with a modified example file that
	  uses a PositionAttitudeTransform to draw the Earth's orbit around
	  the Sun."

2009-04-09 14:00  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "Here is a first cut at the mime-type support
	  we discussed a little while ago
	  (http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-users@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg23098.html)
	  
	  Background: when you access a file over HTTP, you cannot rely on
	  a file extension being present; instead the file's mime-type is
	  conveyed in the HTTP Content-Type response header. This facility
	  adds a mime-type-to-extension map to the registry to handle this.
	  
	  There are two new osgDB::Registry functions which are pretty
	  self-explanatory:
	  
	  void addMimeTypeExtensionMapping( mime-type, extension )
	  ReaderWriter* getReaderWriterForMimeType( mime-type )
	  
	  I also added the file osgDB/MimeTypes.cpp which houses a
	  hard-coded list of built-in types. I took the list from here
	  (http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/mime-types.shtml) and then
	  pared it down to include mostly image and video types, editing
	  them to map to existing plugins where possible.
	  
	  In addition, I updated the CURL plugin to a) install a set of
	  built-in mime-type mappings, and b) use them to look up an
	  extension in the event that the target filename does not have an
	  extension.
	  
	  Here is a test case. This URL pulls down a JPEG (without a file
	  extension):
	  osgviewer --image
	  "http://us.maps3.yimg.com/aerial.maps.yimg.com/ximg?v=1.8&s=256&t=a&r=1&x=0&y=0&z=2"
	  "

2009-04-09 09:25  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "As I discussed in the thread "Windows
	  7 beta: "The binary is not a valid Windows image."" on osg-users,
	  I needed to add the /DYNAMICBASE linker option for executables to
	  link properly in release mode on Windows 7 beta.
	  
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.graphics.openscenegraph.user/42400
	  
	  Since this is a workaround for a bug in a beta OS (which may or
	  may not be fixed, since it's mentioned in their release notes so
	  they may just leave it as it is) I've marked the option as
	  advanced, default to OFF, and clearly documented it as being
	  useful for Windows 7 only. I'd like to be able to test for
	  Windows 7 directly instead of the blanket IF(WIN32), but I can't
	  figure out if this is possible in CMake.
	  
	  Here's the modified CMakeLists.txt. It's a small change, with low
	  impact, but will be useful to others who test out this OS and
	  when it comes out. Note that I'm not familiar with this option in
	  general, and didn't get any feedback to my questions in the
	  above-mentioned thread, one of which was: Could we just add this
	  option to all builds? What is the impact? That's still unclear to
	  me, but without it OSG executables don't build, and the article I
	  linked didn't seem to present any ill effects to enabling the
	  option."

2009-04-09 09:23  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, clean up of CMake files

2009-04-08 14:16  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "
	  The osgViewer::CompositeViewer had partial support for Producer
	  Camera
	  config files, but it was not working completely. Here is the
	  completed
	  implementation. File: src/osgViewer/CompositeViewer.cpp.
	  "

2009-04-08 14:08  robert

	* From Cory Riddell, fix for aspect ratio

2009-04-08 14:06  robert

	* From James Killian, "refactored the management of the object
	  cache enabling/disabling"

2009-04-08 13:40  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky,"libosgViewerd.so was not being built
	  properly because it was being
	  linked with system libraries using LINK_INTERNAL instead of
	  LINK_EXTERNAL. This caused it to try to link with libXrandrd
	  instead of
	  libXrandr, which failed. Attached is the fixed CMakeLists.txt."

2009-04-08 13:21  robert

	* From Mike Connell, "Here are some small fixes that allow you to
	  specify the allowable deviation when creating polylines from arcs
	  and circles in DXF files. Changes are against 2.8.0
	  
	  It adds two options:
	  
	  Accuracy(x) - ensures the polyline will be within x units from
	  the ideal arc/curve
	  ImproveAccuracyOnly - do not use the given accuracy 'x', if it
	  would result in a worse curve than with the previous (2.8.0)
	  implementation for a particular arc/curve.
	  
	  As an added bonus there was a small bug in the existing
	  implementation whereby the primitives were line strips but the
	  vertices generated were actually suitable for GL_LINES, so the
	  improved accuracy doesn't even have to come at a performance cost
	  :-)"

2009-04-08 13:16  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowky, ""Running" was spelled "Ruinning", which is
	  hardly the same."

2009-04-08 13:11  robert

	* From Marc Sciabica, made searching of the install path for
	  plugins option, and added the dll path to the search path under
	  Windows

2009-04-08 13:03  robert

	* Reduced the default live video feed size to accomodate reading
	  from the Minoru stereo wecam.

2009-04-08 12:32  robert

	* From Simon Carmody, "Patches for compare and copy of Programs and
	  related state
	  -Added copying of shaders and attributes in osg::Program copy
	  constructor.
	  -Changed StateSet::compare function to compare Uniforms and their
	  override values. Previously it compared a RefUniformPair."

2009-04-08 10:48  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "Attached is a patch for osgUtil::Optimizer.
	  If you run the SpatializeGroupsVisitor on a scene graph
	  containing Geodes, StateSets attached to Geodes can be lost.
	  
	  The problem is in SpatializeGroupsVisitor::divide(osg::Geode*,
	  unsigned int) where the code creates a new Group and divides up
	  the input Geode into one Geode per Drawable.
	  
	  I fixed the problem by assigning the Geode's stateset to the new
	  parent group.
	  
	  To replicate the bug, see attached osg/dds files:
	  
	  osgviewer b.osg -- model renders correctly
	  set OSG_OPTIMIZER="SPATIALIZE_GROUPS"
	  osgviewer b.osg -- textures are missing."

2009-04-08 10:44  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-04-07 08:43  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber:

2009-03-25 11:17  robert

	* Added new virtual reseveElements, setElement, getElment and
	  addElement methods to DrawElements
	  to make is easier to write code that can work on
	  DrawElementUByte, UShort or UInt.
	  
	  Changed the osgTerrain::GeometryTechnique so that it
	  automatically chooses
	  the use of DrawElementUShort or DrawElementsUInt accordining to
	  the size of the tile.

2009-03-24 23:25  robert

	* Added support for adding .ffmpeg to filenames to force selection

2009-03-23 16:45  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attached is a very small fix for the ffmpeg
	  plugin, to build it without compiling errors on MSVC. The ffmpeg
	  win32 pre-built tarball is downloaded at
	  http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/builds/. Tested on Windows XP SP3 and
	  Visual Studio 9, but don't know if it still workable for Unix and
	  Mac users. :)
	  
	  Please look at the .diff files for details. I have already
	  enjoyed the latest Chinese *big* movie "Red Cliff" with the fixed
	  ffmpeg plugin and osgmovie. :D"

2009-03-23 16:31  robert

	* From Csaba Halasz, "I have modified FltExportVisitor to use
	  _MSC_VER instead of _WIN32 in
	  the condition around a #pragma warning that is specific to visual
	  studio as _WIN32 is also defined for mingw compile but the
	  #pragma is
	  not applicable there."

2009-03-23 16:28  robert

	* From Csaba Halasz, "IIRC the C++ standard says members will be
	  initialized in declaration
	  order, and not in the order they are listed in the constructor.
	  To
	  avoid possible trouble, gcc warns about this. Attached
	  modification
	  fixes the initializer order to silence this warning."

2009-03-23 16:25  robert

2009-03-23 16:07  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, "Here's a small simplification of the
	  osganimationmorph example. Only one morphtarget needs to be added
	  to the MorphGeometry since it already has a base geometry. The
	  animation will morph between the base geometry and the first

2009-03-23 16:01  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "Here's the promised cleanup of the OSG's

	  environment variable. This submission fixes that problem."

2009-03-23 11:53  robert

	* From Maciej Krol, "As promised to Roland I assembled simple
	  shader generator. ShaderGenVisitor converts accumulated fixed
	  function pipeline state sets to ones with shader programs.
	  Generated state sets are attached to geometries and stored in
	  ShaderGenCache for reuse.
	  
	  Very simple cases of state configuration are supported (all the
	  ones I really need):
	  - single per pixel not attenuated non spot light source ON/OFF
	  - exp2 fog ON/OFF
	  - diffuse texture in rgb + optional specular gloss in alpha
	  (Texture unit 0) ON/OFF
	  - normal map texture (Texture unit 1 and Tangent in
	  VertexAttribArray 6) ON/OFF
	  - blending and alpha testing (not in shader pipeline)
	  
	  To view fixed function pipeline files and paged databases simply
	  run >osgshadergen myfile.osg"

2009-03-13 11:01  robert

	* Fixed for division by zero issue.

2009-03-13 10:40  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "The attached ReaderWriterGLSL.cpp
	  conveniently sets the shader type when
	  the filename extension is "vert" or "frag" but still lets this be
	  overridden by the Options (for those crazy people who store their
	  fragment shaders in .vert files :) )."

2009-03-12 17:54  robert

	* From Frank Midgley, "I tried running osgconv --formats yesterday
	  on OS X and got no results. Turns out the changes discussed in
	  the "osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins win32 fix" thread back in Sep
	  '08 broke this. The OSG_PLUGIN_EXTENSION macro is being defined
	  in src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt from CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
	  which is "dylib" on OS X. The problem is that all of the plug-ins
	  are setup in OsgMacroUtils.cmake with:
	  
	  ADD_LIBRARY(${TARGET_TARGETNAME} MODULE ${TARGET_SRC}
	  ${TARGET_H})
	  
	  which gives them .so extensions. Since ".so" != ".dylib"
	  osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins finds no plug-ins. I believe the
	  correct solution is to use CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX instead.
	  This builds and runs correctly on OS X but I have not tested on
	  other platforms.
	  
	  Attached is an updated src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt based on rev
	  9915. The change is at line 108. To validate: build and then run
	  bin/osgconv --formats. You should get many screenfuls of plug-in
	  features, extensions and options."

2009-03-12 17:47  robert

	* From Konstantin Sinitsyn, "At this moment, I just introducing to
	  OSG. When I reviewing optimizer code, I find a mistake in
	  Optimizer::RemoveLoadedProxyNodesVisitor, as it seems. This
	  optimizer removes proxy nodes that fully loaded and in some cases
	  attach their childs to parrents directly (without creating of
	  group). I dont understand how this works, because if proxy node
	  doesn't have any attributes such as name, description, node mask
	  and any callbacks, then new group does not created to hold proxy
	  node childs. And code below trying to attach their children to
	  all parents but seems like only first child beeing attached to
	  all parents correctly.
	  
	  "

2009-03-12 17:26  robert

	* Introduced a releaseAllOperation after completeion of
	  OperationThread::run() to enable CUDA integration (in osgCuda) to
	  be able to free up its resources. Code drawn from a submission
	  from Mick.

2009-03-12 17:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-03-12 15:21  robert

	* Moved IncrementalCompileOperation out of
	  include-src/osgUtil/GLObjectVisitor into their own files.
	  
	  Added support to IncrementCompileOperation for controlling how
	  much time is alloted to compilation and flush

2009-03-12 15:18  robert

	* Added support for tracking the time since the last clear() call
	  to enable other
	  classes to be able to find out how long the current graphics
	  frame has been running.

2009-03-12 10:12  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "I've been looking at the discussion from
	  2006 ("[osg-users] osgDB/Reentrant Mutex not threadsafe ?") about
	  this, and having looked closely at OpenThreads::ReentrantMutex
	  it's still not thread safe in the following situation:
	  
	  In my example case, there are 2 threads - one is a worker thread
	  created by OpenThreads::Thread. The other thread is the main
	  thread i.e. the thread that is intrinsically created when you
	  execute the application. The crucial problem is that for the main
	  thread, OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread() will return null.
	  
	  I'll demonstrate this by breaking ReentrantMutex::lock() into
	  sub-statements:
	  
	  1.) if
	  (_threadHoldingMutex==OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread())
	  
	  2.) if (_lockCount>0){
	  
	  3.)
	  OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex>
	  lock(_lockCountMutex);
	  ++_lockCount;
	  return 0;
	  
	  4.)
	  int result = Mutex::lock();
	  if (result==0)
	  {
	  OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex>
	  lock(_lockCountMutex);
	  
	  5.)
	  _threadHoldingMutex = OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread();
	  _lockCount = 1;
	  return result;
	  
	  
	  An error will occur in the following case:
	  1) The worker thread calls lock(), it gets to the start of
	  statement 5.
	  2) The main thread calls lock(). Statement 1 is evaluated as true
	  as _threadHoldingMutex is null, and
	  OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread() returns null.
	  3) The worker thread executes statement 5.
	  4) The main thread executes statement 2 and evaluates it as true,
	  because the worker thread has set _lockCount to 1. The main
	  thread executes statement 3, and now can access the mutexed-data
	  at the same time as the worker thread!
	  
	  The simple solution to this is to always protect access to
	  _lockCount and _threadHoldingMutex using _lockCountMutex. I have
	  done this in the file I am submitting."

2009-03-11 18:13  robert

	* Changed audio playing so that it only happens for a single movie
	  to avoid
	  problems with audio stalling.

2009-03-11 17:57  robert

	  enabling blending.
	  Added handling of Image::getPixelAspectRatio() in geometry
	  sizing.
	  Added scaling of the projection matrix to ensure that aspect
	  ratio is honoured with running in fullscreen mode

2009-03-11 15:12  robert

	* From Tanguy Fautre,
	  
	  Clean up of the FFmpeg plugin's class API/AudioStream API.
	  Implementation of isImageTransparent().
	  Implementation of Image:g/setPixelAspectRatio()

2009-03-11 14:18  robert

	* Added View::removeEventHandler(..) method and added check into
	  addEventHandler() to prevent handlers being added twice.

2009-03-11 14:08  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "At a cost of bumping the required version to
	  CMake 2.4.4 (released all the way back on November 21, 2006)...
	  this cmake script patch
	  
	  1. Makes IF/ELSE/ENDIF code blocks easier to read by replacing
	  code like this:
	  
	  IF(FOO)
	  MESSAGE("FOO is true")
	  ELSE(FOO)
	  MESSAGE(" ??? ELSE(FOO)??? ")
	  ENDIF(FOO)
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  IF(FOO)
	  MESSAGE("FOO is true")
	  ELSE()
	  MESSAGE("FOO is clearly false")
	  ENDIF()
	  
	  2. Also adds an ELSEIF() where it makes sense to do so (safe to
	  use as of CMake 2.4.4)"

2009-03-11 13:27  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "I've spent the past four days playing with PNG
	  files on 3DS objects, and I think I may have come across a small
	  issue with the 3DS loader.
	  
	  At the company where I work we model literally thousands of 3DS
	  models for all types of objects. Most don't have transparent
	  textures applied to them, but a few do. The issue is that a
	  texture may have an alpha channel defined, yet its 3DS material
	  definition is not marked as being an alpha source, or
	  transparent. This can happen for any number of modelling reasons
	  (so I'm told) but the net effect is that when a 3DS object is
	  loaded with such a material applied, the stateset creation for
	  the 3DS geometry omits to add the GL_BLEND attribute as neither
	  of the conditions that it currently tests for are satisfied under
	  this scenario.
	  
	  However, one thing that is apparently an indication of
	  transparency/alpha information that we do make use of when
	  modelling, but that the 3DS reader omits to test, is that we
	  assign to the transparent texture to the opacity_map of the 3DS
	  material structure.
	  
	  Now, having discussed with our modellers the theory behind the
	  opacity map, it seems that it is safe to say that if an opacity
	  map is specified, then the reader should really apply the
	  GL_BLEND attribute as it is an indication of some form of
	  blending being required between materials.
	  
	  With this in mind, I have made a minor change to the function
	  createStateSet below, from the ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file, that
	  checks for an opacity map having been specified, and in such a
	  scenario the GL_BLEND attribute is applied to the geometry. This
	  fixed our issue, and thought it might be helpful to others."

2009-03-11 13:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "small addition to osg::Texture to
	  include all possible depth test variants for
	  the shadow depth comparison."

2009-03-11 12:55  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, files were are missed by Robert in check in
	  of changes to GraphicsWindowCarbon.cpp

2009-03-11 12:08  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "the attachment contains a correction of the
	  Optimizer::MergeGeometryVisitor.
	  When 2 geometries are merged, the primitive sets of the second
	  geometry
	  are copied to the first geometry.
	  
	  The primitive sets were copied with a std::insert into the first
	  geometry
	  primitive set vector. It doesn't work when the geometry is using
	  VBOs (because
	  the element buffer object of the primitive set is not updated).
	  
	  The correction replaces
	  
	  lhs.getPrimitiveSetList().insert(
	  lhs.getPrimitiveSetList().end(),
	  rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().begin(),
	  rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().end() );
	  
	  by
	  for( primItr=rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().begin();
	  primItr!=rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().end();
	  ++primItr )
	  {
	  lhs.addPrimitiveSet(primItr->get());
	  }"

2009-03-11 11:58  robert

	* Fixed crash due to Geometry::copyToAndOptimize(..) not handling
	  cases where indices are present, but no arrays are assocaited
	  with them.

2009-03-11 11:29  robert

	* From David Callu, "osgManipulator Object have not META_Object
	  macro call in class definition.
	  > I add META_OSGMANIPULATOR_Object macro which define className,
	  libraryName,
	  > isSameKindAs methods.
	  > Clone method is not appropriate for osgManipulator Object."

2009-03-11 11:00  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "The copy constructor of the nodes and the
	  drawables do :
	  
	  Node::Node(Node &node, copyop) :
	  _stateSet(copyop(node.getStateSet()),
	  
	  It doesn't call the setStateSet method of osg::Node (or
	  osg::Drawable). So the parent
	  list of the state set is not updated with the new node
	  (drawable)."

2009-03-11 10:50  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, added get/setScrollWheelZoomDelta() support
	  for controlling the mouse scroll wheel zoom delta.

2009-03-11 10:34  robert

	* Converted tabs to four spaces

2009-03-11 10:34  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "refactored the code and moved
	  some stuff out into DarwinUtils.h/.mm so both implementations can
	  share
	  some of the code. There's even a bugfix for GraphicsWindowCarbon,
	  which
	  fixes some issues with multiple windows on different screens."

2009-03-10 17:51  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "an other topic pointed out by some
	  Microsoft verification tool:
	  On destruction of some static variables, the global referenced
	  mutex is used
	  to lock access to the parent lists of state attributes, nodes and
	  so on.
	  This even happens past the mutex is already destroyed.
	  
	  This change to Referenced.cpp revision 9851 uses the same
	  technique like the
	  DeleteHandlerPointer already in Referenced.cpp to return an zero
	  pointer for
	  the global referenced lock if it is already destroyed."

2009-03-10 17:47  robert

	* From Konstantin Matveyev, submitted by Valery Bickov:
	  
	  "There is error in WoW shader, you can see it by this simple
	  example:
	  osgviewer cessna.osg --wowvx-42 --clear-color 0,0,0
	  
	  Clear color may be choosed any with at least one component equals
	  to 0
	  or 1. In my case I see weird blinking between normal image and
	  image
	  with depth map at right side on the screen."

2009-03-10 17:39  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "Modified osgGA::TrackballManipulator so
	  that osgGA::GUIEventAdapter::SCROLL performs a zoom.
	  Arbitrarily zooms 10% in/out for each click."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, flipped the orienation of the zoom to
	  make the right mouse key zoom and the scroll wheel work in the
	  same direction.

2009-03-10 17:27  robert

	* Completed support for automatic detection of plugin features.

	* quitened down debug info

2009-03-10 16:52  robert

	* Made bool isImageTranslucent() const virtual to allow subclasses
	  to provide their own implementation

2009-03-10 15:00  robert

	* From Ralf Habacker, "The appended patch fixes this issue by
	  adding a virtual method named supportedFeatures() to the class
	  ReaderWriter, which could be overriden by a specific plugin to
	  adjust the set of features.
	  Single features are implemented as bits asother enums in
	  ReaderWriter class already does, so that combinations are
	  possible and fast comparison operations are possible
	  
	  By default all features are enabled.
	  
	  I have added this virtual method to the dot plugin to get an idea
	  how to use these features.
	  
	  With this patch osgconv --formats shows an additional line
	  'features' for each plugin"

2009-03-10 14:15  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, "While working on the Collada plugin I
	  noticed that all geometry created by the dae reader result in
	  slow path geometry.
	  Because there already exists the option to convert slow path
	  geometry to the fast path by computing an internal fast path
	  alternative, I added a new optimizer option that automatically
	  does this. To check the results I also made some changes to the
	  statistics gathering and rendering.
	  
	  Somewhat unrelated, but also part of the optimizer I disabled
	  removal of CameraView nodes during RemoveRedundantNodes
	  optimization.
	  As discussed on the ML, CameraViews were removed from the
	  scenegraph. This solves that issue.
	  
	  Summary:
	  -Geometry::areFastPathsUsed now also looks at
	  internalOptimizedGeometry
	  -Added Optimize option to make all slow path geometry compute
	  their internal fast path alternative
	  -Added fast geometry counter to the statistics
	  -Disabled removel of CameraViews in optimizer
	  "

2009-03-10 13:46  robert

	* Added copyright + fixed typo

2009-03-10 12:21  robert

	* From Stephan Huber,
	  "Attached you'll find a proposal for using different
	  protocols. The idea behind the new code is:
	  
	  1.) plugins/apps register protocols which they can handle. This
	  is done
	  via osgDB::Registry::registerProtocol(aProtocolName). Plugins
	  register
	  supported protocols as usual via
	  ReaderWriter::supportsProtocol(..), the
	  Registry is updated accordingly.
	  
	  2.) osgDB::containsServerAddress checks first for an appearance
	  of "://"
	  in the filename and then checks the protocol against the set of
	  registered protocols via
	  Registry::isProtocolRegistered(aProtocollName)
	  
	  3.) the other getServer*-functions changed as well, there's even
	  a
	  getServerProtocol-function
	  
	  
	  With these changes filenames/Urls get routed to loaded plugins
	  even with
	  different protocols than 'http'."

	* From Martin Spott, compile fixes for IBM AIX.

2009-03-10 10:56  robert

	* From David Callu, "Problem:
	  osgText::Text and osgText::Text3D use the same font file.
	  The first really load the file and obtain an osgText::Font
	  object,
	  the second use the cache created during the first load of the
	  font file, and so obtain an osgText::Font object instead of
	  osgText::Font3D object. To obtain an osgText::Font3D object,
	  osgText::Text3D call osgDB::readObjectFile(...) with an option
	  to specify the plugin we want an osgText::Font3D instead of
	  osgText::Font.
	  
	  Generalised Problem:
	  In osgDB::Registry, loaded file cache is referenced by the name
	  of this file, so if I load a file with some options, and the
	  cache
	  already contain object for this filename, I obtain an object
	  potentially not loaded with my options.
	  
	  Behaviours:
	  Cache management is delegate to osgDB::Registry, but cache
	  coherence (load a file with option then reuse it, deactivate the
	  cache when load a specific file or don't cached the loaded file)
	  is user's responsibility.
	  
	  Text3D solution:
	  Postfix the font file name by .text3d or something similar and
	  then have the freetype plugin return
	  osgText::Font3D when it detects this.
	  This operation is done by osgText::readFont3DFile() which unsure
	  the filename have .text3d as extension.
	  This is totaly transparent for user, and backward compatible.
	  
	  
	  BTW, I fix the bug about the Normal of 3D text. Currently, the
	  front and wall face have
	  the same normal (0,0,1) in the Text3D object coordinate. Now the
	  wall face have its own
	  normal array computed by the plugin.
	  
	  BTW 2, I implement
	  - void Text3D::accept(osg::Drawable::ConstAttributeFunctor& af)
	  const
	  - void Text3D::accept(osg::PrimitiveFunctor& pf) const
	  so now statistics are well reported.

2009-02-27 10:47  robert

	* From Atr Tevs,
	  
	  first email:
	  "in the current implementation of
	  osgUtil::RenderStage::drawInner() method, there is some wrong
	  assumptions made. The problem is, that whenever one does use
	  multisampling functionality, the Blit operation (which suppose to
	  copy the content of multisampled FBO into the usual one) doesn't
	  perform well in some cases.
	  
	  I've attached a corrected version of the RenderStage. It do just
	  add one line, which enables the multisampled FBO as a readable
	  just before the usual FBO is set as writable. With these
	  corrections the Blit operation performs now correct and allows
	  using of multisampled rendering results further."
	  
	  second email:
	  "There was a problem when blitting the multisampled FBO with
	  internal formats. The default internal format of color buffered
	  multisample FBO was GL_RGBA. This has converted the color values
	  whenever the FBO content was copied. I've added couple of lines,
	  which do just enable the multisampled FBO internal format in
	  respect to the attached color texture's internal format. This
	  makes it possible to blit even float valued texture, so make HDR
	  with multisampling possible ;)"

2009-02-26 22:09  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "I added FORCE to set cmake vars

	  After
	  specifying ACTUAL_3RDPARTY_DIR, Find3rdPartyDependencies warn't
	  able

2009-02-20 16:27  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I was trying to use the archive output of
	  osgdem without success when
	  I eventually found out that it was now disabled (the mailing list
	  archive tells me it is because of multithreaded write issues with
	  vpn). I then decided to use osgarchive to make it myself from the
	  generated output. However if one of the insert parameters is a

	  viewing
	  osgAnimation animations"

2009-02-20 11:51  robert

	* From Martin Beckett, "I have added support for DXF POINTS to the
	  dxf reader plugin
	  It's really just a cut-paste job from the existing LINE support.
	  
	  The current dxf plugin architecture isn't very efficient,
	  especially if you
	  are loading large point clouds (LIDAR)
	  eg. it makes multiple lookups of the layer name for each vertex.
	  I don't know if I can improve this for the general case or if I
	  have to add a
	  special large point cloud dxf reader."

2009-02-20 11:30  robert

	* From Himar Carmona, "When reading a DXF file, the reader breaks
	  at a debug assertion at vector (it breaks on release version).
	  Inspecting the code show that the cause could be in
	  dxfEntity.cpp.
	  
	  It seems that the problem is an offending "short" used in a for
	  loop, where it should be "int" or "long". It causes an index out
	  of range error. "

2009-02-19 19:05  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne and Robert Osfield, email from Bob : "this fix
	  quashes fbo warnings when the fbo status is 'complete', aka 'ok'.

	* From Christian Buchner, "I am hereby amending the osgforest
	  sample with some code (functionally
	  equivalent to the GLSL shaders sample) that displays the forest
	  with
	  shaders on Intel 945 GM hardware. This card supports OpenGL 1.4
	  and
	  ARB_fragment/vertex_program only.
	  
	  I would be pleased if this change made it into the official set

	* From Riccardo Corsi, "in attach you'll find a patch to cleanup a
	  little bit the (de)initialization code of QuickTime environment
	  from the quickTime pluging.
	  It basically removes the static init() and exit() functions,and
	  move them inside the observer class (the one that cleans
	  everything up when the last media is unloaded).
	  
	  It also add an extra check to clean up on exit if the QuickTime
	  env is initialized, but no media is succesfully loaded / written
	  (it might happens with streaming resources).
	  
	  I tested it under WinXP with zero, one and multiple videos.
	  
	  Stephan reads in copy: could you kindly check if everything runs
	  smooth under OSX as well? Also, have you got a chance to test it
	  with streaming media?

2009-02-09 22:12  robert

	* Merged from OSG-2.8 branch the suppression of the wrapping of the
	  ScopeLock<Mutext>

2009-02-09 21:48  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "The .osg plugin doesn't seem to support an
	  option to write shader files
	  separately, so it always inlines them in the .osg file (as far as
	  I can
	  tell). This change adds that ability. "

2009-02-09 21:42  robert

	* From Ralf Habacker, fix to memory leak in

2009-02-08 19:30  robert

	* Fixed handling of a series of \n in the text string so that the
	  correct line spacing is maintained.

2009-02-08 15:56  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "While trying out the osgbrowser example (where
	  I had forgotten to update
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the XUL libs would be found) I noticed that
	  although
	  the gecko plugin was found it could not be loaded. But this did
	  not
	  trigger any visible warning/error message (at least not without
	  INFO
	  notify level). Would you mind if we change the notify level for a
	  dlerror() to WARNING? This will also make it more explicit for
	  the case
	  when a plugin isn't actually found, which seems to come up a lot
	  for
	  novice users (e.g. no freetype on win32, so no freetype plugin,
	  etc).
	  Also, the current error message is misleading ("Warning: Could
	  not FIND
	  plugin to ...") because the it's not always a case of not finding
	  the
	  plugin. I slightly enhanced the situation of not finding a plugin
	  versus
	  finding it but not being able to load it.
	  
	  Here's also a few fixes to some of the examples:
	  - osgfont: make usage help line more in line with the actual
	  behaviour
	  - osgcompositeviewer: complain when no model file was provided
	  - osgmovie: don't include quicktime-dependent feature on Linux
	  - osgocclussionquery: comment addition (as I was surprised that
	  lines
	  were being drawn in a function called createRandomTriangles())"

2009-02-07 11:30  robert

2009-02-06 10:35  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "here are some minor fixes to notify
	  warnings were the std::hex modifier was
	  used but never restored to the decimal notation. That made OSG
	  print messages
	  like the following after some notifications:
	  
	  Warning: detected OpenGL error 'invalid value' after
	  RenderBin::draw(,)
	  RenderStage::drawInner(,) FBO status= 0x8cd5
	  [...]
	  Scaling image 'brick_side.JPG' from (1b4,24f) to (200,200) <---

2009-02-06 08:46  robert

	* Added support for VS versioning of OpenThreads

2009-02-05 15:22  robert

	* From Fabian Lavignotte, "Here is some various small fixes i have
	  done while playing with
	  osgAnimation.
	  - Animation : removed the _name attribute that is never used.
	  - BasicAnimationManager : fix a crash on Windows with the example
	  osganimationviewer. The _lastUpdate attribute was not initialized
	  when
	  using copy constructor.
	  - CMakeLists.txt : add RigGeometry to the headers list"

2009-02-05 12:21  robert

	* From Morne Pistorius, "Attached is a modified version of the
	  QOSGWidget example that shows
	  the workaround we discussed for adding/removing views in a
	  composite
	  viewer at runtime. A dummy view is added to the viewer to always
	  keep
	  it live.
	  
	  Also, I added a #define to the Qt event relay methods to not
	  override
	  them on a Windows system. This fixes the bug where duplicate
	  events
	  are being sent and making it impossible to throw the trackball."

	  FluidFrictionOperator_readLocalData and
	  FluidFrictionOperator_writeLocalData."

2009-02-02 14:43  robert

2009-01-29 13:17  robert

	* Added osgcluster example into build system

2009-01-29 11:18  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "Somehow, one of the shaders in the bsp plugin
	  started behaving incorrectly between the original submission and
	  now. I suspect it has to do with a typo in the setup of the
	  shader that was fixed at some point, or it happened during the
	  recent warnings purge. In any case, I had to invert the usage of
	  a parameter in the shader to make it behave properly again.
	  
	  
	  The vtf plugin wasn't working in Windows due to OS differences in
	  the byte-packing of the header structure (on Windows, the big
	  block read was causing a buffer overrun). I fixed this by reading
	  the structure from the file field by field. It's now happy on
	  both Linux and Windows."

2009-01-29 11:03  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-01-29 10:43  robert

	* Revised the message about install path.

2009-01-29 10:22  robert

2009-01-29 09:28  robert

	* Improved the handling of toggling of GL_LIGHTi modes when
	  SceneView::setLightingMode() is toggled on/off.

2009-01-29 09:27  robert

	* Replaced -1 with ~0u to fix warning due to being written to a
	  UInt field. Note, OpenFlight spec says -1, which is clearly an
	  error in the spec, so we've had to guess at ~0u being an
	  appropriate value.

2009-01-29 09:24  robert

	* Removed now redundent shader files.
	  
	  Fixed the adding of transfer function property.

2009-01-28 13:45  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "1) Changes the order of the camera stats
	  slightly, to be more in line with
	  the view stats
	  2) Uses a slightly smaller block for view statistics"

2009-01-28 12:55  robert

2009-01-28 11:59  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have today built svn trunk on HP-UX
	  and Solaris8.
	  I had to do two small changes to src/osgWidget/Input.cpp and
	  src/osgAnimation/Animation.cpp mainly because of name lookup
	  problems.
	  "

2009-01-28 11:16  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, removed accounting of local to world
	  transform on the force vector as the particle velocity should
	  already been in world coords. Fixing this addresses a bug where
	  particles accelerated out of the scene rather than slowing down.

2009-01-28 10:06  robert

	* Added check against existing of a valid Stats object in
	  ViewerBase::renderinTraverls() to prevent crash.
	  
	  Added default View Stats into src/osgViewer/View.cpp to enable
	  stats to be collected for views

2009-01-28 09:42  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "this is a semi-submission based on what
	  you and others have been
	  talking about in the LIB_POSTFIX thread. It is a bit verbose
	  perhaps
	  and the message I emit during the make install step flashes by
	  and
	  gets burried under all "installing..." and/or "up-to-date..."
	  messages. I have posted on the cmake mail list on ways to do this
	  better.
	  
	  The submission adds:
	  * message to user during configuration that s/he's eventually
	  going o
	  install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}lib${LIB_POSTFIX}
	  * if system has /etc/ld.so.conf.d and it is a dir generates
	  packaging/ld.so.conf.d/openscenegraph.conf and creates a custom
	  target
	  for installing it (target must be run explicitly of course). User
	  is
	  notified of this during configuration (may not be necessary)
	  * emit a message during installation that libraries are put in
	  <same-as-above>. This message unfortunately gets emitted to soon
	  for
	  the user to see it
	  
	  * I added "COMPONENT libopenscenegraph-dev" to the pkgconfig.pc's
	  install command
	  * Moved the section with OSG_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE as close
	  to
	  the end of CMakeLists.txt as I dared. This is the intent of this
	  construct I think."

2009-01-28 09:31  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgViewer::StatsHandler. It
	  has the following changes:
	  - The text and dark background rectangles are now correctly
	  placed, and
	  slightly resized here and there.
	  - All counters (vertices, etc) now use a fixed formatting with 0
	  digits
	  precision, to prevent the text from being shown in scientific
	  notation
	  when the number get large (e.g. 6.34344e+6). I tested with a
	  scene
	  containing roughly 4 million vertices, to make sure its stats
	  would
	  display correctly.
	  
	  I also made slight changes to osgcompositeviewer (attached) to
	  aid in
	  testing the stats display, specifically displaying of camera and
	  view
	  names."

2009-01-28 09:26  robert

	* From Paul Melis, remove redundent spaces

2009-01-28 09:24  robert

	* From Paul Melis, removed redundent spacing.

2009-01-28 09:23  robert

	* Fixed the handling of setLightingMode and inheritCullSettings so
	  that it properly manages the GL_LIGHTING mode

2009-01-28 09:21  robert

	* From Patrick Hartling, "I encountered a bug related to RTTI for
	  subclasses of osg::Shape. The
	  circumstances under which this bug occur are rather specific, but
	  the
	  basic problem occurs when one translation unit other than
	  libosg.so
	  constructs an object that is a subclass of osg::Shape and another
	  translation unit other than libosg.so tries to perform a
	  dynamic_cast or
	  other RTTI-based operation on that object. Under these
	  circumstances,
	  the RTTI operation will fail. In my case, the translation units
	  involved
	  were an application and osgdb_ive.so. The application constructed
	  a
	  scene graph that included instantiations of subclasses of
	  osg::Shape.
	  Depending on how the user ran the application, it would write the
	  scene
	  graph to an IVE file using osgDB::writeNodeFile(). The
	  dynamic_cast
	  operations in DataOutputStream::writeShape() would fail on the
	  first
	  subclass of osg::Shape that was encountered. This is because
	  there were
	  two different RTTI data objects for all osg::Shape subclasses
	  being
	  compared: one in the application and one in osgdb_ive.so.
	  
	  The fix for this is simple. We must ensure that at least one
	  member
	  function of each of the subclasses of the polymorphic type
	  osg::Shape is
	  compiled into libosg.so so that there is exactly one RTTI object
	  for
	  that type in libosg.so. Then, all code linking against libosg.so
	  will
	  use that single RTTI object. The following message from a list
	  archive
	  sort of explains the issue and the solution:
	  
	  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/1688156
	  
	  While the posting has to do with Boost.Python, the problem
	  applies to
	  C++ libraries in general."

2009-01-28 09:06  robert

	* Added back in intializers for RenderSurface.

2009-01-27 15:35  robert

	* Removed .pc files as they are now automatically generated with
	  the correct values by Cmake from the openthreads.pc.in and
	  openscenegraph.pc.in files.

2009-01-27 15:34  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "I have modified CMakeLists.txt in order to
	  make CMake fill the existent
	  openscenegraph.pc and openthreads.pc files with OSG's
	  installation values.
	  Then I install those files into the expected path for pkg-config
	  (this can
	  also be modified through PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable).
	  Therefore
	  those of us who are using pkg-config for linking can easily
	  select which
	  version of OSG we want to use."

2009-01-27 15:34  robert

2009-01-27 15:14  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a small fix that enables writing 16
	  bit short images in the tiff plugin.
	  "

2009-01-27 14:11  robert

	* Converted viewer camera references to use observer_ptr<> rather
	  than ref_ptr<> or C pointers to avoid issues with circular
	  references/dangling pointers.

2009-01-27 13:23  robert

	* Refactored the view stats.

2009-01-27 09:09  robert

	* Commented out debug message

2009-01-26 21:23  robert

	* Ported onscreen camera stats across to using thread safe stats
	  collection

2009-01-26 19:22  robert

	* Added passing of command line args to cmake

2009-01-26 16:55  robert

	* Converted across to using ref_ptr<> to avoid memory leak/dangling
	  pointer issues.

2009-01-26 15:16  robert

	* Fixed effective leak in Program::PerContextProgram caused by
	  previously osg::State keeping a set of
	  std::ref_ptr<Program::PerContextProgram> without ever pruning
	  this list.
	  The fix was to convert the osg::State to use C pointers for the
	  set of applied PerContexProgram objects, and use the osg::Oberver
	  mechanism to avoid dangling pointers for being maintained in
	  osg::State.

2009-01-26 13:48  robert

	* Moved the XRANDR include into LIB_PRIVATE_HEADERS to avoid
	  FreeBSD build problem

2009-01-26 10:52  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-01-26 10:35  robert

	* From Rick Appleton, "In DatabasePager.cpp I believe there's a
	  copy-paste ommission. A little bit further down the file where
	  the Drawables are compiled the code is similar to how I have
	  fixed the code here for the StateSets. If the DatabasePager
	  thread is supposed to pre-compile things, it will call the
	  compileGLObjects such that compileAll will be true. However, when
	  compiling StateSets compileAll isn't currently checked."

2009-01-24 10:02  robert

	* Changed META_NodeVisitor usage to META_Object as it's more
	  appropriate.

2009-01-24 10:00  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "OS X failed to compile AnimationManager
	  because of
	  the useage of META_Node-macro, but AnimationManager is inherited
	  from
	  NodeVisitor, so I changed the Macro to META_NodeVisitor"

2009-01-23 23:04  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2009-01-23 15:52  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, "attached is a small crash fix for the case
	  that a texture is used for transparency without the availability
	  of a diffuse texture."

2009-01-23 15:50  robert

	* Added forward declaration of callbacks to headers to avoid
	  scoping issues of classes with same names.

2009-01-23 15:12  robert

	* Warning fixes for VS, and removal of associated warning disables

2009-01-23 15:02  robert

	* Added workaround for silly posix read deprecation warning under
	  VS.

2009-01-23 14:00  robert

	* Removed unneccesary warning disables

2009-01-23 11:52  robert

	* Added range of visual rendering properties to readNode's creation
	  of VolumeTile/ImageLayer.

2009-01-23 10:29  robert

	* From Mattias Froehlich, "To pass the Microsoft application
	  verifier we have tried to get osgviewer
	  working with that thing.
	  This is what was missing so far:
	  
	  Make win32 threads behave like the posix implementation when
	  setting thread
	  cpu affinity. That includes avoid setting thread affininty on a
	  non running
	  thread. Set that once it is running."

2009-01-23 09:24  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "here is a correction on
	  osgVolume/Property
	  added OSGVOLUME_EXPORT to PropertyAdjustmentCallback
	  
	  osgVolume/VolumeTile.cpp
	  in copy constructor, removed ';' on if
	  (volumeTile.getVolumeTechnique())"
	  

2009-01-23 09:22  robert

	* Upped notification level of timing stats

2009-01-21 19:28  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-01-21 19:02  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "updated osgAnimation with the trunk here the
	  update:
	  
	  examples/osganimationviewer/AnimtkViewer.cpp:
	  - add option to display bone (--drawbone)
	  - dont crash if the file does not contains a
	  AnimationManagerBase, display the content only
	  
	  examples/osganimationviewer/AnimtkViewerGUI.cpp:
	  - adjust the path of image for the gui
	  
	  include/osgAnimation/Interpolator:
	  - add warn message instead of old assert
	  
	  include/osgAnimation/Bone:
	  src/osgAnimation/Skeleton.cpp:
	  - change a method name to fit better with what it does.
	  setMatrixInSkeletonSpace instead of setBoneInSkeletonSpace
	  
	  include/osgAnimation/Skinning:
	  src/osgAnimation/RigGeometry.cpp:
	  - add patch from Fabien Lavignotte to compute normal correctly
	  
	  include/osgAnimation/Sampler:
	  - adjust behviour without assert, return 0 instead of crashing
	  "

2009-01-21 19:01  robert

	* Fixed compile errors for when ref_ptr<> auto conversion is
	  disabled

2009-01-21 18:47  robert

	* From Roger James, The changes are as follows:-
	  
	  1. Support for ambient occlusion maps.
	  2. A fix for the incorrect handling of normals on all geometries.
	  The optimizer usually fixed this bug so it probably was not
	  noticed very often.
	  3. A new option flag on the reader. "StrictTransparency"
	  // Process transparent and transparency settings according to a
	  strict interpretation of the spec
	  // See https://collada.org/public_forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1210
	  otherwise
	  // Jump through various hoops to accomodate the multiplicity of
	  different ways
	  // that various people have interpreted the specification
	  4. Handling of texures in the transparent channel. This is
	  allowed provided that they are the same texture that is specified
	  in the diffuse channel. Accomodating a different texture would
	  require use of programmable pipeline functionality which I have
	  tried to avoid.
	  5. Handling of <bind_vertex_input> elements.
	  ""

2009-01-21 18:34  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "got some feedback from J-S on the
	  packaging so I have changed the
	  name of the top folder in each package to OpenSceneGraph-x.y.z
	  
	  Noone else has had an opinion on whether compiler and it's
	  version
	  should be part of the package filename on their platform/setup so
	  I'll
	  leave it as is. That is - No action is taken for compilers other
	  than
	  msvc but one can easily add this information to the cmake cache
	  regardless of platform.
	  "

2009-01-21 18:23  robert

	* Replaced readImageFile() usage with readRefImageFile() to prevent
	  threading issues with caching of imagery in the osgDB::Registry
	  cache.

2009-01-21 17:10  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I realized today that there is an issue
	  with the Registry changes I submitted to allow plugins to have
	  the first go at URLs.
	  
	  The code works fine as is if the format plugin is not already
	  loaded in memory.
	  
	  If a plugin is already in memory, say the PNG plugin for example,
	  then a call to readImageFile("http://server.com/image.png") will
	  return FILE_NOT_FOUND because osgDB::findDataFile will not be
	  able to locate the file. So the Registry::read method is
	  returning before the CURL plugin is given a chance to download
	  the file.
	  
	  I've made a few changes to the Registry to not return
	  FILE_NOT_FOUND if the filename contains a URL that fix the
	  issue."

2009-01-21 14:37  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Minor change to the glPushAttrib(...) call
	  in
	  renderWithStencilBuffer(...) - added GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT"

	  Updated wrappers

2009-01-15 10:36  robert

	* From Rudolf Wiedemann, "attached is the osg::Camera class (based

	  methods
	  getProjectionMatrixAsOrtho()
	  getProjectionMatrixAsFrustum()
	  getProjectionMatrixAsPerspective()
	  getViewMatrixAsLookAt() (2x)
	  are now const, as they only call const methods of osg::Matrixf/d.

	* Changed to use ref_ptr<> for scene model to avoid crash

2009-01-12 11:34  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "'ve finally finished the rework of the
	  packaging support. It is
	  streamlined for tgz and has most of the features that Robert, J-S
	  and
	  Sukender requested in december. I have an idea of how to discover
	  the
	  vc80 sp1 or not but haven't had time to implement. The script is
	  completely reworked and now doesn't include cmakes' bundled
	  CPack.cmake script at all. In summary:
	  
	  * filenames are
	  <package>-<osgversion>-<platform>-<arch>[-compiler]-<configuration>.tar.gz,
	  ex. libopenscenegraph-2.7.9-Linux-i386-Release.tar.gz,
	  libopenthreads-dev-2.7.9-win32-x86-vc80sp1-Debug.tar.gz
	  
	  * targets (projects in msvs) are generated for each specified
	  component, a target that packages everything that is installed
	  (openscenegraph-all) and there's a target for running all other
	  packaging targets (Package ALL on msvs, package_ALL in unix
	  makefiles).
	  
	  * It is possible to set the compiler in ccmake (cmake-gui,
	  whatever you use)
	  
	  * the top folder in packages is the same for all packages
	  (OpenSceneGraph-x.y)
	  
	  * the packaging support is limited with cmake-2.6.0 and not as
	  dynamic. With cmake-2.6.1 and later building the gdal plugin (for
	  example) will create a package_libopenscenegraph-gdal target.
	  With
	  cmake-2.6.0 only the ones that are always built
	  (libopenscenegraph,
	  libopenscenegraph-dev, openscenegraph, libopenthreads,
	  libopenthreads-dev
	  
	  * i found a better way to decide whether cpack is available to
	  guard
	  the BUiLD_OSG_PACKAGES option"

2009-01-09 19:53  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Following reports by Alberto and Simon
	  this submission reenables usage
	  of cmake-2.6.0. As a side note I just installed cmake from the
	  ubuntu
	  repositories and got cmake-2.6.0-4ubuntu2 and this one produced
	  the
	  currect CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE (-O3 -DNDEBUG). This CMakeLists
	  is
	  tested on linux with cmake versions 2.4.8, 2.6.0, 2.6.2 and
	  2.6.0-4ubuntu2
	  
	  * Added quotes around CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS var to help cmake-2.6.0
	  pick up
	  that it really is a string value
	  
	  * Removed quotes around values that we set in
	  OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARNING_FLAGS. This makes
	  OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARING_FLAGS be
	  of LIST type so the foreach constructs can behave as I planned."

2009-01-09 15:57  robert

2009-01-08 11:28  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, added back in missing wd entries.

2009-01-08 11:26  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "With msvc90 on vista and cmake-2.6.2 i had
	  to rearrange the blocks
	  that set aggressive warnings in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and the on that
	  processes the source tree(s) or the newly set flags wouldn't take
	  effect until second consecutive configure.
	  
	  I also replaced the internally cached variables that managed the
	  aggresive warnings with explicit adding and removing of flags in
	  CXX_FLAGS
	  
	  For apple we first required min cmake version 2.6.0 and then had
	  code
	  warning about using 2.4.x"

	  atomic_cas_ptr, which takes a void* and has been given a const
	  void* const."

2009-01-08 11:15  robert

	* From Blasius Czink, "It seems there is no atomic_xor_uint_nv(). I
	  attached a changed version of the Atomic header where a mutex
	  fallback
	  is used for "xor" on solaris."

2009-01-08 10:34  robert

	* Moved supression of VS warning C4706 from the include/osg/Export
	  header into the CMake options list. Added suppression of C4127 as
	  well.

2009-01-07 15:35  robert

	* Fixed assingment operator

2009-01-07 15:33  robert

2009-01-06 19:08  robert

	* Updated path to reflect where the new button images are located.

2009-01-06 16:45  robert

	* From Don Leich, "Here are a couple of fixes for the file
	  examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp to
	  address some OS X issues. Most of these fixes were previously
	  submitted by Julian Scheid. However, this patch however should
	  not break the example for non-OS X builds and has been tested on
	  64-bit Linux as well as Mac OS X 10.5.
	  
	  o The value returned by QWidget::winId() is not usable as input
	  for
	  WindowData under OS X the way it is for both Windows and Unix.
	  Julian's fix
	  for this uses the Carbon API. Since the fix for X11 in unknown,
	  it is now
	  assumed that OSG has been built with
	  OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM='Carbon' for this
	  example to work at all when running under OS X.
	  
	  o The CompositeViewer version would hang on exit with the
	  original timer start
	  argument. Changing the argument value to match the non-composite
	  version
	  seemed to cure the hanging.
	  
	  o Julian's patch altered the setGeometry position to 30/30 in
	  order to see any
	  window decorations. I did not have this problem, but left his
	  changes intact.
	  
	  o The non-composite viewer needed it's camera initialization
	  defered until
	  after the ViewerQOSG's Qt base class had been initialized.
	  Otherwise, the view
	  did not cover the entire window.

2009-01-06 16:35  robert

	* From Ewe Woesnner, "the Inventor loader crashes when a texture

2009-01-06 16:16  robert

	* From Sergey Leontyev, "Some minor(but important) bug fixes for
	  osgWidget:
	  
	  
	  
	  1. In WindowManager.cpp childRemoved method the second parameter
	  "end" is misleading and
	  
	  should be named "numChildren" instead. It represents how many
	  children to remove. As a result, the method was implemented
	  incorrectly and failed to remove UI objects. So I fixed it.
	  
	  
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  
	  
	  void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int
	  end) {
	  while(start < end) {
	  Window* window = getByIndex(start);
	  
	  if(!window) continue;
	  
	  if(_remove(window)) {
	  window->_index = -1;
	  
	  window->unmanaged(this);
	  }
	  
	  start++;
	  }
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int
	  numChildren) {
	  for (unsigned int i = start; i < start+numChildren; i++)
	  {
	  Window* window = getByIndex(i);
	  
	  if(!window) continue;
	  
	  if(_remove(window)) {
	  window->_index = -1;
	  
	  window->unmanaged(this);
	  }
	  }
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  2. in Input.cpp
	  
	  
	  
	  The cursor in Input did not get positioned correctly, probably as
	  a left over from the TOP LEFT origin system which is now BOTTOM
	  LEFT.
	  
	  in method positioned()
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y - _cursor->getHeight() +
	  1.0f);
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y + 1.0f);
	  
	  
	  
	  Now it is placed correctly.

2009-01-05 17:35  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I thought about the issue I was having with
	  the CURL plugin automatically trying to download all filenames
	  with URL's rather than passing the full URL to the plugin. It
	  turns out the solution was pretty simple.
	  
	  I've made a small change to Registry.cpp that puts the CURL logic
	  AFTER the URL has been passed to the plugin rather than assuming
	  all URL's need to be downloaded by the CURL plugin. This way,
	  plugins can have first crack at the URL's, and if they don't
	  handle it the previous CURL behavior kicks in."

2009-01-05 17:06  robert

	* From Paul Martz, added --points option for forcing points
	  rendering of polygonal models

	* From Roland Smeenk, "Attached you will find an improved Collada
	  plugin to properly support camera's.
	  A Collada camera will be added to the scenegraph as
	  osg::CameraView. This allows the user to create a set of
	  predefined camera viewpoints. I also added a new
	  MatrixManipulator to osgGA called CameraViewSwitchManipulator and
	  added usage of this to the osgviewer example. This manipulator
	  allows switching between the predefined camera viewpoints. The
	  current design limition I ran into is that a MatrixManipulator
	  only manipulates the ViewMatrix, but for this particular
	  manipulator I also want to update the projectionMatrix of the
	  camera when switching to a new viewpoint. This is not implemented
	  because I don't know what would be the best way to design it. Any
	  ideas?
	  
	  Furthermore Collada also supports orthographic camera's, where an
	  osg::CameraView only supports a perspective camera. Would it be
	  useful to create a CameraView with customizable optics for this?"

	* From Paul Martz, "Typing "osgconv" alone displays the --help
	  family of options, as it should, but it also displays info about
	  --formats and --plugins, which seems out of place because no
	  other options are mentioned here.
	  
	  The code changes osgconv so that "osgconv --help" displays help
	  info about --formats and --plugins, plus it also displays
	  documentation for --format and --plugin, which were previously
	  missing."

2008-12-21 20:42  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Replace the IF(POLICY CMP0008) with an
	  absolute version check for

	  The POLICY keyword is only valid starting with cmake-2.4.7 so
	  using it

	  inches.

2008-12-20 13:35  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "'ve been busy working on the Source engine
	  plugins. There are several contributions in this submission:
	  
	  osgDB/FileUtils.cpp:
	  Needed this extra code to allow a true case-insensitive search.
	  This is because the HL2 map and model files are often sloppy with
	  case. For example, the file might look for
	  materials/models/alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf, but the file is actually in
	  materials/Models/Alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf. In case-insensitive mode,
	  the new code recursively disassembles the path and checks each
	  path element without regard to case. In case-sensitive mode, the
	  code behaves exactly as it used to. The new code is also mostly
	  skipped on Windows because of the case-insensitive file system.
	  Previously, I did all of this with custom search code in the .bsp
	  plugin, but this allows the user to tailor the search using
	  OSGFILEPATH. There are some instructions in the plugins' README
	  files about this.
	  
	  osgPlugins/mdl:
	  This is a new plug-in for Half-Life 2 models (as opposed to
	  maps). This allows you to load Source models individually, as
	  well as allowing the .bsp plugin to load models (props) that are
	  embedded into maps. Mdl files can contain simple object (crates,
	  barrels, bottles), as well as fully articulated characters with
	  skeletal animations. Currently, it can load the simple objects.
	  It can also load the characters, but it can't load the skeletons
	  or animations.
	  
	  osgPlugins/bsp:
	  This contains all of the changes needed to load props along with
	  the basic map geometry. There are also
	  several bugs fixed.
	  
	  osgPlugins/vtf:
	  This is the loader for Valve's texture format. Previously, we had
	  agreed to put this in with the bsp plugin, but I didn't think of
	  the .mdl plugin at that time. It's conceivable that a user might
	  want to load models individually (not as part of a map), so the
	  vtf reader does have to be separate. I also fixed a rather
	  significant bug.
	  
	  I tested all of this code on RHEL 5.2 (32-bit), and Fedora 9
	  (64-bit). I'll be testing on Windows soon.
	  
	  I also attached a simple .mdl file, along with it's associated
	  files and textures. Just extract the tarball into it's own
	  directory, set your OSGFILEPATH to point at that directory, and
	  load the model like this:
	  
	  osgviewer models/props_junk/gascan001a.mdl"

2008-12-19 17:15  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastein Guay, I recently had to reimplement screen
	  capture functionality into our framework (which was broken since
	  the switch from OSG 1.2 to 2.2 over a year and a half ago). I
	  used the ScreenCaptureHandler which I had contributed right
	  before OSG 2.6 shipped, bit I had to trigger the screen capture
	  programatically instead of by a key press in some cases, so I
	  added a convenience method to do that.
	  
	  It's a minimal change, it just calls an already existing
	  protected method. It was trivial to subclass the handler to do it
	  in our code, but pushing the change into OSG makes sense as it's
	  generally useful to have it in the handler itself.
	  
	  I also noticed that the handle() method was overridden from
	  osgGA::GUIEventHandler but wasn't marked virtual. It wasn't
	  intended that subclasses not be able to override it in turn, so
	  I've added the keyword.""

2008-12-16 15:21  robert

	* From Mathias Froehilch, "
	  On OpenThreads win32 implementation we unconditionally unlock a
	  mutex in the
	  destructor. That happens even if the mutex was not locked before.
	  When running a osg application within microsofts application
	  verifier, that
	  software checks tells me that we should not unlock an unlocked
	  mutex.
	  
	  When I look at the posix threads mutex implementation, which does
	  no unlock in
	  the destructor and where it is illegal to destroy a locked mutex,
	  I conclude
	  that it is not needed for an OpenThreads::Mutex to do that unlock
	  in the
	  win32 Mutex destructor.
	  
	  Thus this patch based on rev 9358 removes that additional unlock
	  in the win32
	  mutex implementations destructor."

2008-12-16 15:08  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing,"Added
	  doc/Doxyfiles/openthreads.doxyfile.cmake
	  Updated all doxyfiles under doc/Doxyfiles. They are now all
	  processed
	  by cmake but make targets are only generated for
	  OpenSceneGraphReferenceDocs and OpenThreadsReferenceDocs. The
	  others
	  can be run with doxygen directly in <builddir>/doc.
	  Fixed a copy-paste in openthreads sproc and pthreads CMakeLists
	  Added the osg logo to the html footers
	  Added possibility to get generation of chm files.
	  
	  CMakeLists (toplevel):
	  Added install of osg and ot reference docs. This also generates
	  packaging targets of openscenegraph-doc and openthreads-doc if
	  you
	  have packaging enabled
	  Removed the unused USING_OP_OT_TRIPLE_SET since there was no way
	  of
	  enabling it anyway
	  Removed BUILD_REF_DOCS. IMO it was redundant -
	  BUILD_DOCUMENTATION
	  does the same thing and we get that anyway from including
	  Documentation.cmake.
	  OsgCPack.cmake:
	  Removed generation of PACKAGE_SRC for msvc
	  Added special handling for -doc packaging targets - they don't

2008-12-15 22:18  robert

	* Added support for a Terrain::s/getTerrainTechniquePrototype()

2008-12-15 20:38  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, "I found a bug in GraphicsWindowCarbon.
	  GraphicsWindowCarbon::requestWarpPointer() places the mouse
	  pointer in a (global?) display coordination, but it must be in a
	  local window coordination. This problem is critical because the
	  mouse cursor can go off a window especially when you place the
	  window on the secondary screen.
	  
	  Attached is the file to fix this problem.
	  
	  I tested this modified file with the following situations (on
	  FlightGear) and all works fine.
	  - two windows on two screens (each has one window).
	  - two windows on two screens (secondary screen has all windows).
	  - two windows on two screens (primary screen has all windows).
	  
	  In all scenarios, warp requests (by right-click the mouse)
	  successfully moves the mouse pointer to the center of the main
	  window,
	  and it is what it's supposed to be in the flightgear."

2008-12-15 20:32  robert

	* Limited the static build to just osversion and osgstaticviewer

2008-12-15 19:37  robert

	* Aded osg::isGLExtensionOrVersionSupported(uint contextID, char*
	  extensionName, float minVersionRequired) method that
	  returns true if (the extension string is supported or GL version
	  is greater than or equal to a specified version) and
	  non extension disable is used. This makes it possible to disable
	  extensions that are now
	  available as parts of the core OpenGL spec.
	  
	  Updated Texture.cpp is use this method.

2008-12-15 16:46  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "I'm not sure why this message was added, but it
	  doesn't appear to merit INFO verbosity. Changing this from INFO
	  to DEBUG_FP."

2008-12-15 16:42  robert

	* From Peter Hrenka, "I implemented a free list reallocation scheme
	  in
	  VertexBufferObject::compileBuffer().
	  
	  The offsets of newly added Arrays were not properly
	  calculated. This submission tries to find a
	  matching empty slot when the total size of
	  the VBO has not changed (e.g. when an array
	  is replaced by another array of the same size).
	  
	  
	  This fixes the overwriting issue that I showed in my posting
	  "Bug in VertexBufferObject::compileBuffer" on OSG-Users.

2008-12-15 16:41  robert

	* Reduced the default number _targetMaximumNumberOfPageLOD to 300

2008-12-15 16:10  robert

	* Added deprecated messages to get/set methods of outgoing expiry

2008-12-15 14:07  robert

	* From Mathias Helsing, "Cpack support submission with:
	  
	  Better package naming. example
	  openscenegraph-core-2.7.7-Linux-i386.tar.gz on my ubuntu laptop

2008-12-15 13:56  robert

	* Made the folowing changes to make the DatabasePager more
	  restrained in its memory consumption, and to improve the speed of

	* From Mattias Helsing, "I have developed the earlier cpack example
	  a bit. Perhaps you could
	  consider these initial cpack support scripts. It is hidden behind
	  a
	  BUILD_PACKAGES option so won't affect the normal user. The

	  1) set the COMPONENT attribute on all cmake install commands.
	  COMPONENT names are according to
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Community/Packaging
	  
	  2) provide cmake script and a template for creating CPack
	  configuration files. It will generate target for creating
	  packages

2008-12-10 10:10  robert

	* From Marcin Prus, "some time ago there was an optimization fix

	* From Sukender, (Benoit Neil) "adding a few convinience methods to
	  osg::Node (ouch!). Just tell me if you find them useful:
	  
	  /** Convinience method that sets the update callback of the node

2008-12-03 12:09  robert

	* From Ferdi Smit, "Image.cpp didn't handle the integer data types
	  correctly in the function:
	  
	  unsigned int Image::computeNumComponents(GLenum pixelFormat)
	  
	  so I added these types to the switch statement:
	  
	  case(GL_RED_INTEGER_EXT): return 1;

2008-12-01 14:07  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attachment is a plugin reading Biovision
	  hierarchical files (.BVH) to generate character motion
	  animations. BVH format is widely used by Character Studio of
	  3dsmax, MotionBuilder and other softwares, also supported by most
	  motion capture devices. The plugin is based on the latest
	  osgAnimation library of OSG 2.7.6 and will return a
	  osgAnimation::AnimationManager pointer if using readNodeFile() to
	  load it.
	  
	  Source and CMake files are:
	  
	  CMakeLists.txt
	  ReaderWriterBVH.cpp
	  
	  Also there are 3 example BVH files. The first two are captured
	  from motions of human beings - maybe a kung-fu master here.
	  PLEASE use command below to see the results:
	  
	  # osgviewer example1.bvh -O solids
	  
	  This will demonstrate the animating of a skeleton and render
	  bones as solid boxes. Note that the motion assumes XOZ is the
	  ground and has an offset from the center, so we should adjust our
	  view to get best effects.
	  
	  You may also use "-O contours" to render bones as lines. The
	  viewer shows nothing if without any options because
	  osgAnimation::Bone does not render itself. User may add
	  customized models to each named bones as osganimationskinning
	  does to make uses of this plugin in their own applications.
	  
	  I was wondering to support a BvhNode in my osgModeling peoject
	  before, but soon found it better be a plugin for animation. A
	  problem is, how to bind real geometry models to the skeleton.
	  Maybe we could have a bindingToNode() visitor in future to find
	  geodes matching names of bones and add them as bones' children."

2008-12-01 13:47  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-12-01 13:28  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "here is a submission of an additional class of
	  PixelBufferObejct, which implements more general way of handling
	  with PBOs. Current osg implementation of PBO does use an attached
	  osg::Image to copy data from. This is somehow only one way of
	  using it and doesn't provide full functionality of PBOs.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Descripton:
	  
	  The patch does provide a new class PixelDataBufferObject which is
	  capable of allocating memory on the GPU side (PBO memory) of
	  arbitrary size. The memory can then further be used to be enabled
	  into read mode (GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER_ARB) or in write mode
	  (GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER_ARB). Enabling the buffer into write mode
	  will force the driver to write data from bounded textures into
	  that buffer (i.e. glGetTexImage). Using buffer in read mode give
	  you the possibility to read data from the buffer into a texture
	  with e.g. glTexSubImage or other instuctions. Hence no data is
	  copied over the CPU (host memory), all the operations are done in
	  the GPU memory.
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Compatibility:
	  
	  The new class require the unbindBuffer method from the base class
	  BufferObject to be virtual, which shouldn't break any
	  functionality of already existing classes. Except of this the new
	  class is fully orthogonal to existing one, hence can be safely
	  added into already existing osg system.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Testing:
	  
	  The new class was tested in the current svn version of osgPPU. I
	  am using the new class to copy data from textures into the PBO
	  and hence provide them to CUDA kernels. Also reading the results
	  back from CUDA is implemented using the provided patch. The given
	  patch gives a possibility of easy interoperability between CUDA
	  and osg (osgPPU ;) )
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  I think in general it is a better way to derive the
	  PixelBufferObject class from PixelDataBufferObject, since the
	  second one is a generalization of the first one. However this
	  could break the current functionality, hence I haven't
	  implemented it in such a way. However I would push that on a
	  stack of wished osg 3.x features, since this will reflect the
	  OpenGL PBO functionality through the classes better.

	* From Ulrich Hertlien, "'m was getting a build failure from the
	  OpenEXR reader on Mac OS X. It was complaining about undefined
	  references to half::convert(int). I believe this is because the
	  EXR plugin doesn't explicitly link against the Half library.
	  
	  Attached is a modified FindOpenEXR.cmake module that locates
	  IlmIlf and Half, as well as a modified exr/CMakeLists.txt that

	* From Tim Moore, "Double precision versions of BoundingBox and
	  BoundingSphere are useful for doing computations in world
	  coordinates, especially when working with a geocentric scene. By
	  default, these classes are built using floats, so templated

2008-11-26 12:50  robert

	* From Andy Preece,
	  
	  "To reproduce the bug:
	  
	  1. Create a template osg::Sequence node (and underlying geometry)
	  but do not attach the node to the current active scenegraph.
	  2. At some point during the rendering loop (perhaps on a
	  keystroke) clone the sequence node (I use the call:
	  
	  dynamic_cast<osg::Node*>(templateNode -> clone( osg::CopyOp(
	  (osg::CopyOp::CopyFlags)osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_NODES ) ) )
	  
	  3. Set the cloned sequence node duration to a value that makes
	  the animation run slower (i.e. 2.0).
	  4. Start the cloned sequence (using setMode()).
	  5. Repeat steps 2 \u2013 4 and observe that the cloned sequences
	  do not run slow but run as fast, appearing to ignore the duration
	  that has been set on them.
	  
	  
	  
	  Looking at the \u2018good documentation\u2019 (2.4 source code),
	  I see that _start is being set to _now (osg::Sequence::setMode(),
	  line 192). Should this not _start not be set to -1.0?"

2008-11-26 12:35  robert

	* Added searching for OpenEXR

2008-11-26 12:35  robert

	* From Ragnar Hammarqvist, "I wrote an EXR image plug-in to osg, I
	  would like to contribute this plug-in to the osg project if you
	  find it useful.
	  
	  The plug-in is a wrapper around open-exr (http://www.openexr.com)
	  that consists of two projects, ilmbase-1.0.1 and openexr-1.6.1.
	  
	  I have only tested it on windows XP 32 machine. So there might be
	  some work making it work on other platforms.
	  
	  The plug-in supports writing and reading EXR files. When writing
	  it can use the data type GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB(se ilmbase-1.0.1) and
	  GL_FLOAT. When reading the data type always becomes
	  GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB. It supports textures with three and four
	  channels.
	  
	  When reading an exr file it automatically removes Alfa channel if
	  it didn't store any information."
	  
	  --
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, started work on ported it to other
	  platforms, but could fix some problems relating to error:
	  
	  ?Imf::OStream::OStream(const Imf::OStream&)? is private
	  
	  I'm checking in now so that others can have a bash at completing
	  the port.

2008-11-26 12:07  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "The FindGDAL.cmake seems to be broken
	  in OSG 2.6.1 for locating gdal.h through enviroment variable
	  GDAL_DIR.
	  
	  Also, I've modified the FindCOLLADA.cmake to locate the current
	  2.1 versions of the COLLADA DOM in the build directories under
	  VC8. I've also added a COLLADA_LIBRARY_DEBUG spec. Other flavors
	  may be added depending on compiler version and DOM version."

2008-11-26 11:45  robert

	* From BjornHein, "attached a proposal for an extension for the the
	  stl-File ReaderWriter. It allows saving of an osg node tree as
	  stl file in ASCII-Format.
	  
	  Standard is to generate one stl file.
	  
	  With an additional option it is possible to write one file per
	  Geode. This option is not very "useful" for typical application,
	  I use it for separating and conversion of geometric data. So it
	  could be removed if considered to special."

2008-11-26 11:23  robert

	* From John Vidar Larring, osgautocapture example that captures an

2008-11-25 10:57  robert

	* From Jaromir Vitek, "In attachment are another fixes for using
	  packed depth+stencil (PDS).
	  
	  * When used PDS RenderStage::runCameraSetUp sets flag that FBO
	  has already stencil,depth buffer attached. Prevents adding next

	  * Sets correct traits for p-buffer if used PDS and something goes
	  wrong with FBO setup or p-buffer is used directly.
	  * Adds warning to camera if user add depth/stencil already
	  attached through PDS.
	  * Sets blitMask when use blit to resolve buffer.
	  
	  There is also new example with using multisampled FBO."

2008-11-24 16:32  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I have restored MSVC disabled
	  warnings in osg/Export. Difference is they are now disabled only
	  when OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS macro is defined. This macro is
	  set through CMake options and autogenerated in osg/Config. Simon
	  suggested that it would be cool if we had more control over
	  selected warnings. I tried to learn how to make selection of
	  individual warning numbers possible, but had to gave up as my
	  cmake skills were not sufficient. The only way I saw this
	  possible would be adding one define for each MSVC warning number.
	  But many definitions seemed too be to much clutter for osg/Config
	  file so I rejected thar idea. For this it would be cool if
	  autogenerated Config entries could more powerful than simple
	  #define/#undef flags. Maybe Cmake gurus know how to do it.
	  
	  I have not reverted added Compiler options. I assume that one may
	  want to have warnings enabled for the application but may not
	  want to see them while OSG libraries and examples compile.
	  
	  Modified files:
	  
	  osg/Export - now explicitly includes osg/Config to make sure
	  OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS is read
	  osg/Config.in - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS flag to be
	  added to autogenerated osg/Config
	  CMakeLists.txt - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS as option
	  with default ON setting

2008-11-24 11:39  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "This is a plugin (two, actually) that will
	  allow OSG to load .bsp map files from Valve's Source Engine games
	  (Half-Life 2, etc.). One plugin (called "vbsp" to distinguish it
	  from the Quake 3 bsp loader) reads the .bsp file itself, and the
	  other ("vtf") reads the texture files.
	  
	  The set up for this to work is a bit more complex than most
	  files, since the engine expects all files to be in a certain
	  place, and it tends to mix case a lot. I tried to explain
	  everything in the VBSP_README.txt file."
	  
	  This plugin has been integrated with the pre-exisiting bsp

2008-11-23 10:20  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "I noticed some regression in the BMP
	  loader - some 8-bit (paletted) files wouldn't load anymore but
	  simply crash.
	  
	  After taking a look at the current state of the BMP loader I
	  decided it might be worth a shot at reimplementing that part. For
	  example: the current loader doesn't properly handle 1- and 4-bit
	  files, incorrectly loads 16-bit files as intensity-alpha (they
	  are RGB555), is full of dead code, and generally not in very good
	  shape.
	  
	  Attached is my re-implementation for review.
	  
	  I've checked it against the test images from
	  http://wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu/vmswww/bmp.html and models that use BMP
	  files.

	* From Cedric Pinson, Pulled in osgAnimation from
	  OpenSceneGraph-osgWidget-dev into svn/trunk.

2008-11-21 18:16  robert

	* From Danny Valente, submitted bu Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some
	  context: In the past I submitted a fix to
	  osgViewer::CompositeViewer where events would get wrong input
	  ranges. Later, you made a change to set the eventState's current
	  graphics context to the current graphics context. However,
	  there's a problem in the sequence of events. Here's the recap
	  (doing a graphical diff with the attached file will show this
	  clearly):
	  
	  Before:
	  
	  1. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  1.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  2. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  2.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  2.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  
	  Now as you can see from this sequence, the graphics context is
	  set on the eventState before switching to the view which has
	  focus (and thus using another eventState). So the new eventState,
	  in the case we need to switch views, will contain an old graphics
	  context, not the correct one.
	  
	  Just inversing these steps fixes the problem:
	  
	  1. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  1.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  1.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  2. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  2.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  
	  Now, the eventState will refer to the correct graphics context in
	  both cases.
	  
	  Attached is a fixed CompositeViewer.cpp (based on today's SVN)
	  which does this. Note that some other things are done in the 1.
	  and 2. cases, but they have no influence on each other so they
	  can just be swapped without problems.

2008-11-14 20:50  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "If you change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in the
	  cache editor after building the OSG, it causes the entire project
	  to rebuild (at least with the CMake makefile generator due to
	  changing preprocessor definitions applied across all targets).
	  
	  I suggest moving the definition of OSG_DEFAULT_LIBRARY_PATH
	  (which is responsible for this global rebuild) into
	  osgDB/CMakeLists.txt which is the only library in the code where
	  this definition is (and is likely ever to be) used. This way if
	  the user changes it, only osgDB will rebuild."

2008-11-06 14:04  robert

	* From Csaba Halasz, adding missing export directives

2008-11-06 13:57  robert

	* From Thomas Wedner, "use osgViewer::CompositeViewer with several
	  views. All views share
	  parts of their scene graphs. Within these common part some nodes
	  have
	  event handlers which use the action adapter argument to the event
	  handler to determinate which view received the event.
	  Here is the problem, osgViewer::CompositeViewer::eventTraversal
	  sets
	  the action adapter field in the EventVisitor always to the last
	  view
	  which received an event, instead of using the view which actually
	  received the event, so determination of the correct view does not
	  work.
	  I looked at the code a bit, and moved the code for setting the
	  action
	  adapter to a IMO better place"

2008-11-06 13:40  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertleinm "cmake 2.6 is having trouble on Mac OS X

	* Added sendPointerEvent and sendKeyEvent virtual methods to
	  osg::Image to
	  facilitate the subclassing of Image providing interactive
	  behaviours so as
	  used in the vnc interactive VncImage class.
	  
	  osgViewer::InteractiveImageHandler provides an event handler that
	  convertes osgGA
	  mouse and keyboard events into the coordinate frame of an image
	  based on ray intersection with geometry in
	  the associated subgraph.
	  
	  Changed the ordering of events processing in Viewer and

	* Added --help-env docs for OSG_MAX_PAGEDLOD

2008-10-27 17:11  robert

	* Merged in comment split code from the old flt plugin so that FLT
	  comments string with returns
	  in them are put into separate description entries.

2008-10-27 17:09  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I am sending a really minor fix for
	  StatsHandler::reset method. We dynamically add and remove slave
	  cameras in our application. StatsHandler does not automatically
	  adapt to this situation, and we call StatsHandler::reset to force
	  it to update number of cameras and their graphs. Unfortunately,
	  if stats were already drawn, reset would not remove former graph
	  drawables and they would remain frozen below new stats. This
	  update fixes it.
	  "

2008-10-27 16:16  robert

	* From Chris Denham, default scene that tests the use of in scene
	  graph Camera which has a RELATIVE_RF ReferenceFrame.

	* From Chris Denham, fixed support of in scene graph osg::Camera's
	  with ReferenceFrame of RELATIVE_RF.

2008-10-27 15:26  robert

	* From Katharina Plugge, "I found a bug in the OpenFlight-Plugin.
	  When exporting to OpenFlight it could happen that palettes of an
	  external reference like the texture palette are set wrong,
	  because they are overwritten by parent settings (userData), which
	  actually do not refer to palette entries respectively ParentPools
	  (happens for example if a Transform is parent of a ProxyNode).
	  The static cast from userData to ParentPools should therefore be
	  a dynamic cast.
	  ---------------------------
	  
	  function FltExportVisitor::writeExternalReference( const
	  osg::ProxyNode& proxy ):
	  
	  Line 423 in file expPrimaryRecords.cpp has to be changed from

	* Various warning fixes

2008-10-27 11:49  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-10-27 11:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This change is a result of a recent
	  thread on osg-users.
	  The semantic change that went into the ac loader with the past
	  patch was
	  incorrect wrt the document describing the behaviour of ac files
	  and
	  inconsistent with what ac3d itself displays for that files.
	  This attached change reverts the behaviour to the original one.
	  The
	  infrastructure to change this is left in place.
	  The change is based on rev 9045."

2008-10-27 10:42  robert

	* From Blasius Czink, "Among other things I added support for
	  atomic operations on BSD-like systems and additional methods (for
	  "and", "or", "xor").
	  "
	  
	  and a later post the same osg-submissions thread:
	  
	  "it's been a while since I have made the changes but I think it
	  was due to problems with static builds of OpenThreads on windows.
	  I was using
	  OpenThreads in a communication/synchronisation library (without
	  OpenSceneGraph). It seems I forgot to post a small change in the
	  CMakeLists file of OpenThreads. If a user turns
	  DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS to OFF (static build) OT_LIBRARY_STATIC will
	  be defined in the Config.
	  Without these changes a windows user will always end up with a
	  "__declspec(dllexport)" or "__declspec(dllimport)" which is a
	  problem for static builds."
	  
	  And another post from Blasius on this topic:
	  
	  "I tested with VS2005 and VS2008. For 32 bit everything works as
	  expected. For x64 and VS2008 I could successfully do the
	  cmake-configure and then the compilation but I had occasional
	  crashes of cmTryCompileExec.exe (during the cmake-configure
	  phase) which seems to be a cmake bug. With VS2005 and 64bit cmake
	  does not set _OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED although
	  the interlocked functionality should be there. If I place the
	  source snippet from the CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS macro to a separate
	  sourcefile I can compile and run the resulting executable
	  successfully. Forcing OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED
	  (on VS2005/x64) reveals a bug in "intrin.h" which seems to be
	  fixed in VS2008 but not in VS2005.
	  
	  In case anyone is interested the lines:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long *a, long
	  b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long *a,
	  long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  should be changed to:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long volatile
	  *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long
	  volatile *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  The worst thing that can happen is that interlocked funtionality
	  is not detected during cmake-configure and the mutex fallback is
	  used.
	  Which reminds me another small glitch in the Atomic header so I
	  attached a corrected version.
	  
	  
	  
	  Why is the OT_LIBRARY_STATIC added to the config file? It is not
	  needed anywhere.
	  
	  OT_LIBRARY_STATIC is needed if you are doing static-builds on
	  Windows. See my previous post on that.

	  support. While testing the pluggin we found a small bug and we
	  are
	  submitting a patch.
	  
	  The first attachment is a small program that creates a scene with
	  two
	  pyramids, transformed by two instances of
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform. One of them is rotated 90 degrees
	  in
	  the X axis, and the scene is exported both in the native OSG
	  (.osg)
	  and COLLADA (.dae) formats. In the first case the rotated pyramid
	  is
	  displayed correctly whereas in the second the pyramid seems not
	  to be
	  rotated.
	  
	  In the COLLADA 1.4.1 specification (found at
	  http://www.khronos.org/collada/) it is specified that
	  "The <rotate> element contains a list of four floating-point
	  values
	  [...] followed by an angle in degrees" but the plugin seems to
	  write
	  the value in radians.
	  
	  The problem seems to be in the method daeWriter::apply() that
	  seems to
	  be writing the angle value in radians to the COLLADA file. The
	  patch
	  can be found in the second attachment and is simply a call to
	  RadiansToDegrees wrapped around the angle.

	  This is only true when _offset=identity, so I think it should be

	  This inconsistency can cause problems when switching from UFO to

2008-10-07 13:37  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastirn Guay, "Inspired by the latest additions to
	  the StatsHandler, here is my own addition. It's a graph that
	  helps show the variation of the various stats over time. It's
	  clearer than just having bars for the last 10 frames or so, IMHO,
	  since 10 frames go by pretty fast...
	  
	  The graph is displayed "under" (behind) the normal bar chart you
	  get when you press 's' twice. It doesn't hide the normal stats,
	  you can still read them without any trouble, and that way, it
	  doesn't take any more screen space. It starts from the left, and
	  will scroll left when there is enough data to fill the screen
	  width. The graph lines have the same colors we're used to (except
	  I made the event color a bit bluer, so it's not exactly the same
	  as the update color). A screen shot is attached.
	  
	  The lines get a bit confused when they're all overlapping at the
	  bottom of the graph, but I think that's the least of our concerns
	  (if they're all at the bottom of the graph - except FPS of course
	  - then great!).
	  
	  The only thing I'm not very keen about is that to make things
	  simple, I clamp the values to a given maximum. Right now, the
	  maximums I have set are:
	  
	  * Frame rate: 100 fps (people have 60, 75, 85Hz refresh rates, so
	  there's no one right value, but I think 100 is OK)
	  * Stats: 0.016 seconds (what you need to get 60Hz minimum)
	  
	  This could be changed so that the scale of the graph changes
	  according to the maximum value in the last screenful of the graph
	  instead of clamping values. We would then need to display the
	  scale for each value on the side of the graph, because if the
	  scale changes, you need to know what it is at this moment.
	  
	  I tried to make things easy to change, so for example if you
	  don't like that the graph is in the same space as the normal
	  stats bars, it's easy to move it anywhere else, and make it have
	  other dimensions. The maximums and colors are also easy to
	  change.
	  
	  The impact on performance should be minimal, since it's one
	  vertex per graph line that's added per frame, and vertices are
	  removed when they scroll off the screen, so you'll never have
	  more than say 1280 * (3 + ncameras) vertices on the screen at one
	  time. No polygons, I used line strips. The scrolling is done with
	  a MatrixTransform."

	* From Neil Groves, "Frequently I would like code that has a
	  signature like: void foo(osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node> node) to work
	  for osg::ref_ptr<osg::Group>, osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> etc. The
	  behaviour of osg::ref_ptr does not mimic the behaviour of a raw
	  pointer in this regard.
	  
	  To facilitate this possibility I have added a template copy
	  constructor and a template assignment operator. These work for
	  safe conversions like those in my previous example, but fail as
	  desired for non-safe conversions since the template instantiation
	  fails during the raw pointer copy/assignment.
	  
	  The lack of this facility has appreciably handicapped development
	  of generic algorithms applied to the scene graph, and I believe
	  that this alteration will be welcomed by most of the community.
	  If there are issues with antiquated compilers not supporting
	  template member functions then perhaps a small piece of
	  conditional compilation is in order.
	  
	  I have made the change using the latest release version (2.6) as
	  the base. The full file is attached.
	  
	  I have not tested building the osg wrappers and the script
	  binding code. I have tested the legal and illegal conversions of
	  both copying and assignment to ensure that behave as expected on
	  MSVC7.1, MSVC8, MSVC9, GCC 4.3."

2008-10-03 09:22  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, submissions posted by Stephan Huber,
	  "attached you'll find a modified ReaderWriterQT.cpp-file where I
	  removed the support for rgb(a)-files.
	  Quicktime supports only files with 3/4-channels rgba-files and
	  not 1/2-channels rgb-files.
	  
	  This submission is from Tatsuhiro Nishioka, here's his original
	  quote:
	  
	  When FlightGear crashes, the error message
	  "GraphicsImportGetNaturalBounds failed" shows up. By adding
	  printf
	  debug, I found the error was -8969: codecBadDataErr when loading
	  a
	  gray-scaled (2 channels) rgba files even though the file can be
	  loaded
	  with Gimp and osgViewer properly.
	  
	  So I made an investigation on this problem and found an
	  interesting
	  thing. This error occurs only when non-rgb files are loaded
	  before rgb
	  files. The reason is that rgba files can be handled by both
	  osgdb_rgb.so and osgdb_qt.so, but the error happens only when
	  osgdb_qt.so try to load a gray-scaled rgba file.
	  
	  When a program is about to load an rgba file, osgdb_rgb.so is
	  loaded
	  and it handles the rgba file properly. In contrast, when a
	  gray-scaled
	  rgb file is being loaded after a non-rgb file (say png) is
	  already
	  loaded by osgdb_qt.so, osgdb_qt.so tries to load the file instead
	  of
	  osgdb_rgb, which causes the error above.
	  
	  Anyway, the bad thing is that QuickTime cannot handle gray-scaled
	  rgb
	  files properly. The solution for this is not to let osgdb_qt
	  handle
	  rgb files since osgdb_rgb can handle these properly.

2008-09-18 13:05  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "
	  I think I may have discovered a bug in osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp
	  that results in incomplete shadows being generated.
	  The problem seems to caused by an incorrect interpretation of the
	  spot light cutoff angle. The valid ranges for spot cutoff are
	  0-90 and 180, i.e half the 'field of view' for the spotlight.
	  Whereas the shadow map code seems to assume the the spot cutoff
	  is equal to the field of view. This results in the shadows
	  generated by the spotlight getting clipped at half the spot
	  cutoff angle.
	  
	  I have fixed this in my copy of ShadowMap.cpp:
	  ===============================
	  //Original code from OSG 2.6:
	  if(selectLight->getSpotCutoff() < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we
	  don't need the bounding box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  float spotAngle = selectLight->getSpotCutoff();
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(spotAngle, 1.0, 0.1,
	  1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  ===============================
	  // My modifications:
	  float fov = selectLight->getSpotCutoff() * 2;
	  if(fov < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we don't need the bounding
	  box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(fov, 1.0, 0.1, 1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  
	  This change seems correct for spot cutoff in the range 0, 90, but
	  since OpenGL doesn't claim to support cutoffs >90 && <180, I'm
	  not sure how shadow map should deal with those cases, but
	  ignoring spot cut off greater than 90 here seems reasonable to
	  me.

	* From Alberto Luaces, "Cygwin's cmake build adds a "d" postfix to

	  I have made the same changes in Registry.cpp that are available

	  of platforms appending that "d" to their plugins. I have also
	  updated the
	  CMakeLists.txt file to get "_DEBUG" defined at compilation time.
	  I have
	  copied the already existent conditional block because of cmake's
	  bizarre
	  operator precedence. Since Cygwin defines both CYGWIN and WIN32,
	  the
	  following would suffice:
	  
	  IF(CYGWIN OR UNIX AND NOT WIN32 AND NOT APPLE)
	  
	  Sadly, it actually doesn't work, so I wrote a new conditional

2008-09-17 17:25  robert

	* From Christophe Loustaunau,"
	  I have found some errors on the example osgGeometryShaders. It's
	  about the varying in the geometry shader.
	  take a look at the varying vec4 v_color.
	  In the vertex shader, v_color is initialized to gl_vertex
	  then in the geometry shader v_color is initialized to
	  gl_PositionIn[0]
	  and in the fragment shader v_color is used as the fragment color.
	  
	  Try to initialized v_color to vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) in the
	  vertex shader and comment the line :
	  " v_color = v;\n" in the geometry shader, and you will see the
	  lines as black !
	  
	  It's because you have to use keywords in and out.
	  
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  in - for function parameters passed into a function or for input
	  varying
	  variables (geometry only)
	  
	  out - for function parameters passed back out of a function, but
	  not
	  initialized for use when passed in. Also for output varying
	  variables
	  (geometry only).
	  
	  Then for a geometry shader, a varying must be an array :
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  Since a geometry shader operates on primitives, each input
	  varying variable needs to be
	  declared as an array. Each element of such an array corresponds
	  to a
	  vertex of the primitive being processed. If the varying variable
	  is
	  declared as a scalar or matrix in the vertex shader, it will be a
	  one-dimensional array in the geometry shader. Each array can
	  optionally
	  have a size declared. If a size is not specified, it inferred by
	  the
	  linker and depends on the value of the input primitive type.
	  
	  
	  Here is a patch based on the svn version of osg that correct
	  that.

	  with a
	  transform, or scale matrix is only 4^2 operations. Which is a
	  gain of a
	  *FACTOR*4* for these special cases.
	  The change implements these special cases, provides a unit test
	  for these
	  implementation and converts uses of the expensiver dense matrix
	  matrix
	  routine with the specialized versions.
	  
	  Depending on the transform nodes in the scenegraph this change
	  gives a
	  noticable improovement.
	  For example the osgforest code using the MatrixTransform is about
	  20% slower
	  than the same codepath using the PositionAttitudeTransform
	  instead of the
	  MatrixTransform with this patch applied.
	  
	  If I remember right, the sse type optimizations did *not* provide
	  a factor 4
	  improovement. Also these changes are totally independent of any
	  cpu or
	  instruction set architecture. So I would prefer to have this
	  current kind of
	  change instead of some hand coded and cpu dependent assembly
	  stuff. If we
	  need that hand tuned stuff, these can go on top of this changes
	  which must
	  provide than hand optimized additional variants for the
	  specialized versions
	  to give a even better result in the end.
	  
	  An other change included here is a change to rotation matrix from
	  quaterion
	  code. There is a sqrt call which couold be optimized away. Since
	  we divide in
	  effect by sqrt(length)*sqrt(length) which is just length ...

	* Updated version number for 2.7.1 release, and added
	  OSG_FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL Cmake option
	  that enables the occlusion query workaround for an OpenGL driver
	  crash

2008-08-25 16:43  robert

	* From Doug McCorkle, via Paul Martz who writes : "Summary: Some
	  platforms/configurations cause application crashes if the
	  occlusion query result is not ready for retrieval when the app
	  tries to
	  retrieve it. This fix adds an application-level wait loop to
	  ensure the
	  result is ready for retrieval. This code is not compiled by
	  default; add "-D
	  FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to get this code.
	  
	  Full, gory details, to the best of my recollection:
	  
	  The conditions under which we encountered this issue are as
	  follows: 64-bit
	  processor, Mac/Linux OS, multiple NVIDIA GPUs, multiple
	  concurrent draw
	  threads, VRJuggler/SceneView-based viewer, and a scene graph
	  containing
	  OcclusionQueryNodes. Todd wrote a small test program that
	  produces an almost
	  instant crash in this environment. We verified the crash does not
	  occur in a
	  similar environment with a 32-bit processor, but we have not yet
	  tested on
	  Windows and have not yet tested with osgViewer.
	  
	  The OpenGL spec states clearly that, if an occlusion query result
	  is not yet
	  ready, an app can go ahead and attempt to retrieve it, and OpenGL
	  will
	  simply block until the result is ready. Indeed, this is how
	  OcclusionQueryNode is written, and this has worked fine on
	  several platforms
	  and configurations until Todd's test program.
	  
	  By trial and error and dumb luck, we were able to workaround the
	  crash by
	  inserting a wait loop that forces the app to only retrieve the
	  query after
	  OpenGL says it is available. As this should not be required
	  (OpenGL should
	  do this implicitly, and more efficiently), the wait loop code is
	  not
	  compiled by default. Developers requiring this work around must
	  explicitly
	  add "-D FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to the
	  compile
	  options to include the wait loop."

	* Updated wrappers

2008-08-18 11:21  robert

	* From Sergey Leontyev, "1. In StyleManager
	  
	  
	  
	  when applying styles to a Label element the code below runs in a
	  infinite loop.
	  
	  The reason for this is that nothing increments the Reader "r" in
	  the case when applying a style to label,
	  
	  so I advance the reader when no match was found.
	  
	  ( To replicate the error apply style to any label)
	  
	  
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof()) if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc = true;
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof())
	  
	  {
	  
	  if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r))
	  
	  inc = true;
	  
	  else
	  
	  r.advanceOverCurrentFieldOrBlock();
	  
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  I tested it and it works well for me, I did not find any problems
	  with it.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  2. Added style support for Canvas element, event though there is
	  no styles to apply yet.
	  
	  It is usefull for someone who inherits from Canvas class to
	  develop another element.
	  
	  If applyStyle(Canvas) does not exist
	  
	  there is no way to apply style to the element that inherited from
	  Canvas element.
	  
	  
	  
	  Added virtual
	  
	  bool applyStyle(Canvas).
	  
	  
	  
	  and in added call to apply style if the Object is of type Canvas:
	  
	  StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject(osg::Object* obj, const
	  std::string& style) {
	  
	  ...
	  
	  
	  
	  else if(!std::string("Canvas").compare(c))
	  
	  return _coerceAndApply<Canvas>(obj,style,c);
	  
	  "

2008-08-18 11:17  robert

	* Ran fixtabs to enforce four space tabs

2008-08-18 11:00  robert

	* From Erik van Dekker,
	  
	  "I made several modifications:
	  
	  
	  
	  * The cause of my errors was that my OSG source directory path
	  contains spaces. To fix this issue I wrapped all paths with
	  quotes, as stated in doxygen documentation.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I also received some warning messages about deprecated doxygen
	  settings, which I fixed by updating the doxygen file, i.e.
	  running \u2018doxygen \u2013u doxygen.cmake\u2018. By running
	  this command deprecated doxygen options are removed, some option
	  comments have changed and quite some options have been added (I
	  kept their default settings unless mentioned).
	  
	  
	  
	  * I was surprised to find that the doxygen OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was
	  set to \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/doc\u201d, which does
	  not seem appropriate for out of source builds; I changed this to
	  \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_BINARY_DIR}/doc\u201d. (On the other hand,
	  maybe a cmake selectable option should be given to the user?)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed two warnings I received about unexpected
	  end-of-list-markers in \u2018osg\AnimationPath and
	  \u2018osgUtil\CullVisitor due to excess trailing points in
	  comments.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osgWidget\StyleInterface due to an #include
	  directive (strangely) placed inside a namespace.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osg\Camera due to the META_Object macro that
	  confused doxygen. Adding a semi-colon fixed this.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Removed auto_Mainpage from the INCLUDE option, because I am
	  positive that this file does not belong there; It never generated
	  useful documentation anyway.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I added the OSG version number environment variable to the
	  PROJECT_NUMBER option so that the version number is now shown on
	  the main page of generated documentation (e.g. index.html).
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option FULL_PATH_NAMES to YES, but made sure
	  STRIP_FROM_PATH stripped the absolute path until the include dir.
	  This fixed an issue that created mangled names for identical
	  filenames in different directories. E.g. osg/Export and
	  osgDB/Export are now correctly named.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option SHOW_DIRECTORIES to yes, which is a case of
	  preference I guess.
	  
	  "

2008-08-18 10:47  robert

	* Removed todo entry

2008-08-17 16:52  robert

	* From Maceij Krol, "I have implement frame based expiration of
	  PagedLOD children.
	  
	  New attribute DatabasePager::_expiryFrames sets number of frames
	  a PagedLOD child is kept in memory. The attribute is set with
	  DatabasePager::setExpiryFrames method or OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  environmental variable.
	  
	  New attribute PagedLOD::PerRangeData::_
	  frameNumber contains frame number of last cull traversal.
	  
	  Children of PagedLOD are expired when time _AND_ number of frames
	  since last cull traversal exceed OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY _AND_
	  OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES respectively. By default OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 1
	  which means that nodes from last cull/rendering
	  traversal will not be expired even if last cull time exceeds
	  OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 0 revokes previous
	  behaviour of PagedLOD.
	  
	  Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES > 0 fixes problems of children
	  reloading in lazy rendering applications. Required behaviour is
	  achieved by manipulating OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY and OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  together.
	  
	  Two interface changes are made:
	  
	  DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(double currentFrameTime) is
	  replaced by DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(const osg::FrameStamp
	  &frameStamp). The previous method is in #if 0 clause in the
	  header file. Robert, decide if You want to include it.
	  
	  PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, NodeList
	  &removedChildren) is deprecated (warning is printed), when
	  subclassing use PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double
	  expiryTime, int expiryFrame, NodeList &removedChildren) instead.
	  "

2008-08-17 16:45  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I've got a few machines that OSG
	  incorrectly believes support FRAME_BUFFER_OBJECTS so I am
	  manually trying to set the renderTargetImplementation to
	  PIXEL_BUFFER or PIXEL_BUFFER_RTT. I noticed that this call wasn't
	  setting the camera's overlay data properly because the
	  setRenderTargetImplementation simply calls init() which only does
	  anything for OBJECT_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY. Any
	  subsequent calls to getOverlayData will simply return the cached
	  OverlayData instead of setting it up.
	  
	  My fix updates the camera's render target implementation for all
	  OverlayData objects in the OverlayDataMap."

2008-08-15 17:35  robert

	* From Paul Palumbo, "Fixes a typo in coverage antialiasing code...

	* Updated version numbers in prep for next dev release

2008-08-15 17:25  robert

	* From Frashid Larshkari, "I modified the vertical/horizontal
	  interlace stereo modes so that they
	  use the osg::State::applyMode for enabling/disabling certain
	  while
	  rendering the stencil mask. Previously some of these calls were
	  overriding the scene graph states because the global state was
	  not
	  aware of this change.

2008-08-15 17:18  robert

	* Added support for geometry shader attributes

2008-07-21 21:28  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Changes attached so that the
	  CaptureOperation is passed in the constructor of the
	  ScreenCaptureHandler (default 0 = default CaptureOperation). This
	  way, you can do:
	  
	  viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
	  new osgViewer::WriteToFileCaptureOperation("filename", "jpg")));
	  
	  and the filename will be what you want. The
	  WriteToFileCaptureOperation will add the context ID and the file
	  number (if in SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) to the file name.
	  
	  (The attached also clarifies some notify messages, and corrects
	  the comment when adding the handler in osgviewer.cpp)
	  
	  I also remembered, the current architecture could allow a
	  different CaptureOperation for each context, but currently the
	  API only allows setting one CaptureOperation for all contexts.
	  This could be improved if need be.
	  
	  "

2008-07-12 12:00  robert

	* From Doug McCorkle, "Attached is patch that corrects/improves the
	  following issues with the OBJ loader:
	  
	  1. Added options to control wether the osgUtil::Tessellator or
	  osgUtil::TriStripVisitor are run. By default they still run just
	  as before.
	  2. Added support for the Emissive material. The data was being
	  read from the mtl file but was never being applied to the model.
	  3. This is the main bug addressed, when a model is read in with
	  an alpha value specified like:
	  
	  newmtl Material__8
	  Ns 24
	  d 0.33
	  illum 2
	  Kd 0.204 0.204 0.204
	  Ks 0 0 0
	  Ka 0.153 0.153 0.153
	  
	  where the alpha value is d. The loader would then overwrite the
	  alpha value when reading the diffuse, specular, and ambient
	  colors. I have changed all the material color readers to only set
	  the values they read and to use the default colors specified in
	  the constructor of the obj class. With these changes, the obj
	  reader now handles opacity correctly if the alpha value is
	  specified before the material colo"

	  readerWritterTiff :
	  It check the data type of the image ( img.getDataType() ) and if
	  it's GL_FLOAT :It save the tiff with float values.
	  Otherwise it does the same thing as before."

2008-07-11 19:23  robert

	* From Liang Aibin, " In lastest svn version of OSG, the .ive
	  plugin missing osg::Light, it
	  does not process I/O for osg::Light. Now I have fixed it as
	  follows:
	  
	  2. In DataInputStream.cpp, I add support code in
	  DataInputStream::readStateAttribute
	  for osg::Light.
	  
	  3. In DataOutputStream.cpp, I add support code in
	  DataOutputStream::writeStateAttribute
	  for osg::Light.

2008-07-11 17:46  robert

	* From Joakim Simmonson,
	  "Opcodes.h:
	  * Added INVALID_OP as -1 in the Opcodes enum. Note that
	  INVALID_OP is not an actual opcode defined in the OpenFlight
	  format. The purpose of INVALID_OP is to mark an opcode variable
	  as invalid or uninitialized.
	  
	  ReaderWriterFLT.cpp:
	  * The header node is returned if it exists, even if the file does

	  INVALID_OP."

2008-07-11 17:41  robert

	* From Joakim Simmonsson, fixed various spelling typos in comments

2008-07-11 17:35  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Due to the recent data variance
	  changes/discussion:
	  Change the ac3d loader that can as such only deliver static
	  models to set the
	  data variance to static for the returned model.
	  "

	  is insticated by pressing 'c' key

2008-07-09 19:26  robert

	* Introduce a intersecion performance testing code path, #if def'd
	  out for now.

	  culling implemented

2008-07-07 10:46  robert

	* Added KdTreeBuilder calls into FindCompileableGLObjectsVisitor,

2008-07-07 09:40  robert

	* Changed types to avoid warnings under Windows

2008-07-06 18:27  robert

	* Changed the DatabasePager so that it bypasses the
	  Registry::readNode() method and calls

	* Moved KdTree build code into osg::KdTree

2008-07-05 17:29  robert

	* Added handling of co-incident start and end points.

2008-07-05 16:39  robert

	* Ported intersection code to use new
	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector/IntersectionVisitor.

2008-07-04 19:16  robert

	* Added KdTree intersection support into LineSegmentIntersector

2008-07-04 15:57  robert

	* Added prelimnary KdTree data structure and automatic kdtree build

	* Introduced bounding boxes to KDLeaf and KDNode structs

2008-07-03 15:49  robert

	* Added new data structure + build algorithm that places triangles

	  so that they
	  may overlap.

2008-07-03 15:01  robert

	* From Mario Valle, "xed the following warning on Linux 64 bits
	  Athlon:

2008-07-03 11:07  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The check for Leopard to build 4-way
	  binaries by default was broken. Here is an updated CMakeLists.txt
	  file to fix the problem."

2008-07-03 10:24  robert

	* Implement an experiemental triangle kdtree building support

2008-07-03 10:03  robert

	  nature

2008-07-02 10:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-07-02 09:25  robert

	* Introduced support for UNSCPECIFIED and STATIC DataVariance of

2008-07-01 19:04  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "There is a problem reading bmp files
	  containing a colour palette,
	  due to an incorrect scan line length calculation. Attached is a
	  fix,
	  and a little bmp file which demonstrates the problem."

2008-07-01 18:37  robert

	* From Lilin Xiong, "I change ive plugin a little for osgText
	  inout, so the ive plugin supports backdrop setting,
	  and Text3D, FadeText inout :
	  
	  1. in DataInputStream.cpp, add 1286--1293 lines;
	  2. in Text.cpp, add some code for text's Backdrop setting;
	  3. in IveVersion.h, add line 39, increase the VERSION to
	  VERSION_028(line 41)
	  4. in ReadWrite.h, add line 146,147
	  5. add file FadeText.h, FadeText.cpp, Text3D.h, Text3D.cpp."

2008-07-01 13:56  robert

	* Added Vec3Array arrange pointer to avoid dynamic cast

2008-07-01 09:40  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "It appears not to be sufficient to set a
	  cmake variable to get a define in
	  such a config file. Instead set that variable to 1. Also included
	  a small compile fix, that appears to be required than ..."

2008-06-30 16:53  robert

	* Added guards against FBO not being supported/setup

2008-06-29 13:41  robert

	* Updated README date for 2.5.3 dev release

2008-06-29 12:22  robert

	* Changed the Optimizer::StateVisitor so that it can individually
	  decide whether
	  to optimize away duplicate state with dynamic, static and
	  unspecified DataVarience. By default
	  the code now optimizes away duplicate state with either static
	  and unspecied state, previously
	  it was just handling static state.

2008-06-28 16:59  robert

	* Added realize of new graphics contexts to handle new views being
	  added with
	  unrealized windows

2008-06-27 19:40  robert

	* Changed back to use an std::vector<> rather than a std::list for
	  RequestQueue to
	  avoid member template problems under Solaris.

2008-06-27 18:59  robert

	* Refactored the sort of the requestQueue so that there is single
	  code path for doing the sort.

2008-06-27 16:47  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Update to the configure check for msvc
	  7.1.
	  MemoryBarrier() is used in the implementation, so it should be
	  checked.
	  This in effect disables the faster atomic ops on msvc 7.1 and
	  older, even if
	  only the MemoryBarrier() call is missing. But it ensures for the
	  fist cut
	  that it will build everywhere. If somebody cares for msvc 7.1
	  enough and has
	  one for testing installed, he might provide the apropriate
	  defines to guard
	  that MemoryBarrier() call.
	  
	  I tested that msvc8 32/64bit still passes the configure tests and
	  compiles.
	  "

2008-06-27 12:44  robert

	* Simplified the MixinVector class so that it no longer supports
	  custom allocators,
	  instead just uses std::vector<>'s default allocators.

2008-06-27 12:35  robert

	* Moved the apply(&) default implementations from the header into
	  the NodeVisitor.cpp,
	  and changed the casts to use static_cast<>.

2008-06-27 11:47  shuber

	* from Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2008-06-27 10:17  robert

	* From Andre Normann, "with version 8504, I am not able to compile
	  osgwrappers under Windows, because there are some DLL export
	  macros missing. I fixed it and put the files in the attached zip
	  file.
	  "

2008-06-26 19:51  robert

2008-06-26 19:47  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-26 19:21  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-26 18:34  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The method
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(osg::PagedLOD&) appears to attempt to
	  identify a "highest res" child of the PagedLOD and only allow
	  intersection on that child. The implementation appears to be
	  flawed in two cases:
	  
	  1) The "highest res" child is assumed to be the child with index
	  "getNumFileNames()-1" or "getNumChildren()-1". As a result,
	  PagedLODs that do not sort children from furthest to nearest will
	  intersect with the wrong child. (see attached "case1.osg" to
	  reproduce this problem.)
	  
	  2) The code assumes there is only one highest res child. As a
	  result. PagedLODs with multiple children at the same highest res
	  range can only intersect one of those children. ("case2.osg"
	  demonstrates this issue; you can only pick the quad on the
	  right.)
	  
	  I've attached a modified IntersectionVisitor.cpp that attempts to
	  resolve these issues. It identifies a highest res range based on
	  the range mode, then continues traversal on all valid children
	  corresponding to that range description. Only in the case of a
	  malformed PagedLOD does the code fall back to getting the last
	  child in the list.
	  "

2008-06-26 18:06  robert

	* From Morten Haukness, "When cloning effects osg crashes because
	  the copy constructur tries to run av pure virtual method
	  (setUpEmitterAndProgram). The right thing to do when cloning an
	  effect is to run the inherited version og buildEffect and
	  setUpEmitterAndProgram.
	  
	  "

2008-06-26 16:45  robert

	* Changed the removeCamera() method so that it now actively calls
	  releaseGLObjects()
	  on all children of a camera that aren't shared with other cameras
	  on that context.
	  
	  This change fixes problems with allocating and deleting views.

2008-06-26 15:06  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, updated CMakeLists.txt to build the
	  Atomic.cpp

2008-06-26 13:09  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski, added enforcement of CMake 2.6.0 under OSX.

2008-06-26 13:08  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski, Cmake support for osgviewerCocoa

2008-06-26 12:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, build fixes for various unices

2008-06-26 10:33  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added do not edit comments to Config.in
	  so that the autogenerated
	  Config files have an appropriate warning notice

2008-06-26 10:27  robert

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "Attached is a change to that atomic
	  stuff to move the win32, msvc
	  implementation of the atomic increment and decrement into a
	  implementation
	  file.
	  This way inlining and compiler optimization can no longer happen
	  for these
	  implementations, but it fixes compilation on win32 msvc targets.
	  I expect
	  that this is still faster than with with mutexes.
	  
	  Also the i386 gcc target gets atomic operations with this patch.
	  By using an
	  implementation file we can guarantee that we have the right
	  compiler flags
	  available."

2008-06-23 15:11  robert

	* Fixed pedantic warning

2008-06-23 14:51  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "fixed win32/win64 configure check and
	  win32/win64
	  atomic related compile failures with msvs2005. Attached changes
	  to make win32
	  really use the atomic stuff. There are pointer typecast problems
	  and some
	  historic alignment restrictions that I just took from a previous
	  similar
	  implementation of mine without looking deep enough. "

2008-06-23 11:14  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "Suibject: CMakeList ADD_DEFINITION for
	  CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX broken
	  I needed a -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX="d" not a
	  -D"CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=d".
	  
	  This corrects the build for the CMake 2.4 and 2.6 series
	  
	  The error was in compiling osgDB/Registry.cpp
	  "

2008-06-23 10:18  robert

	* Commented out the explict install of the Config files as
	  including these files into
	  the header list allows the normal Cmake install support to
	  install them.

2008-06-23 09:57  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I have made a number of changes intended
	  to get a few things working better on OSX. However, since I'm
	  still pretty new at Mac development and cmake I'm not entirely
	  certain that the changes I have made are benign on other
	  platforms. I have tested these changes on Leopard with CMake 2.6
	  generating Xcode 3.0 projects, compiling on ppc and i386 for 10.5
	  and 10.4, and on Linux (CentOS) and everything still seems to
	  work ok. Here are the changes I made (against OSG svn as of this
	  afternoon):
	  
	  - Added osgviewerCocoa example to APPLE builds
	  - Fixed corrupt Xcode project generation with CMake 2.6 dealing
	  with ADD_DEFINITIONS and CMake Policy CMP0005 on Leopard
	  - Resolved CMP0006 warning for examples and programs by setting
	  BUNDLE DESTINATION to same as RUNTIME DESTINATION with CMake 2.6
	  - Fixed freetype plugin on Leopard to avoid OpenGL linking
	  problem
	  - Figured out how to use a custom Info.plist included in the
	  project (see osgviewerCocoa application CMakeLists.txt)"

2008-06-23 08:06  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: added missing config files and updated

2008-06-21 11:34  robert

	* Converted tabs to four spaces

2008-06-20 19:52  robert

	* Changed the include/osg/Config and include/OpenThreads/Config
	  references to use the assocaited CMake variable for these headers

2008-06-20 19:51  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 17:32  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, added missing MixinVector header

2008-06-20 16:57  robert

	* Added OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM cmake option string to allow toggling
	  between X11 and Carbon under OSX.

2008-06-20 15:50  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, moved optional config variables into
	  include/osg/Config file that
	  is automatically created by cmake according to its own settings.

2008-06-20 15:49  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 15:28  robert

	* Changed const double* to const Matrix::value_type* to ensure
	  changes in Matrix type don't break the build

2008-06-20 13:16  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, new flatten static transforms visitor that
	  duplicates subgraphs that are shared beneath differnt static
	  transforms
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, made a range of changes to Terry's visitor
	  integrating it into osgUtil::Optimizer and
	  changing the code to use a style more like the rest of the OSG.

2008-06-20 11:16  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, made the include of bin directory for
	  include/OpenThreads/Config only used when doing out of source
	  builds

2008-06-20 11:11  robert

	* Updated version numbers for dev releases

2008-06-20 10:46  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Fixes a compile of
	  src/osgSim/ShapeAttribute.cpp on suse 10.2."

2008-06-20 09:46  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed typo on variable name

2008-06-20 09:42  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, add search path to enable out of source
	  builds to find include/OpenThreads/Config.

2008-06-19 20:42  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-19 20:38  robert

	* From Neil Groves,
	  
	  "I have taken the liberty of updating a few files so that there
	  is no longer any derivation from std::vector. I have done this by
	  adding a new file osg/MixinVector and by updating only two
	  others: osg/PrimitiveSet and osg/Array. You will notice that this
	  actually removes what is acknowledged as a \u2018hack\u2019 in
	  osg/PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  With the original code I did manage to find memory leaks with
	  some compiler options on VC 8 and 9, as well as Intel compiler. I
	  determined the leak existence by instrumenting the destructor
	  code, and by use of a garbage collector as a leak detector (in a
	  similar manner to the Firefox project). Hence in contrast to what
	  I said originally, it is exhibiting symptoms on at least some
	  platforms.
	  
	  Since I am trying to be a good OSG citizen I got out my editor
	  and started hacking! I have built and tested on Linux (Ubuntu)
	  with GCC 4.x and Windows VC 8 SP1. It appears that nothing is
	  broken, and that I\u2019m using less memory J"

2008-06-19 17:35  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "submission for inclusion to support mpg
	  and avi files when using the quicktime plugin on windows"

2008-06-19 17:30  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added support for using
	  OpenThreads::Atomic for thread safe ref/unref.

2008-06-19 14:57  robert

	* from Andrew Bettison, LineStipple support for .ive

2008-06-19 14:45  robert

	* From Adrian Egli, "Improvements to the PSSM implementation"

2008-06-19 14:35  robert

	* From Rudolf Weidemann, "in the OpenFlight format materials can
	  have editable names.
	  In the OSG OpenFlight plugin these names are ignored when
	  reading, and
	  empty strings are written.
	  
	  As we need these names in the OSG scene graph by our application,
	  I
	  changed the plugin code, so the names are now stored in class
	  "osg::Material" (derived from "osg::Object") by
	  material->setName();
	  (see "PaletteRecords.cpp, line 195) when reading the file, and
	  written
	  to file by
	  dos.writeString( m.Material->getName(), 12 );
	  (see MaterialPaletteManager.cpp, line 80).
	  
	  As these names otherwise get lost when reading an OpenFlight file
	  and
	  writing it again e.g. by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  these changes make the plugin more complete.
	  
	  The changes were made to OSG revision 8425, and were tested by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  comparing the material palettes of both files inside Multigen
	  Creator."

2008-06-19 14:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed some problems when setting up
	  CameraNodes that inherit
	  viewport settings in stereo mode. It seems that the
	  SceneView::cull()
	  method will pass the full size viewport to the left/right
	  cullvisitors, instead of the modified stereo viewport. I made
	  quite a
	  few changes to SceneView to fix the issue. The
	  SceneView::cullStage()
	  method will now receive the viewport as an argument, instead of
	  using
	  the global viewport. The SceneView::cull() method will pass the
	  modifed viewport to cullStage when rendering in stereo.
	  
	  There are 2 new private methods computeLeftEyeViewport() and
	  computeRightEyeViewport() that will compute the stereo viewports.
	  I
	  also modified the draw() function so it applies the correct
	  viewport
	  to the prerender stages. These changes are only necessary for
	  horizontal/vertical split stereo."

2008-06-19 14:14  robert

	* From Andrew Bettison, "Attached are changes for
	  src/osgPlugins/ive (version 2.4.0) that implement LineStipple
	  read/write support for the ive file format."

2008-06-19 13:49  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is a reworked version of the osgviewerWX
	  example. It changes the GraphicsWindowWX to only inherit from
	  osgViewer::GraphicsWindow and adds a standalone widget, called
	  OSGCanvas, that derives from wxGLCanvas. This solves a problem
	  with the GraphicsWindowWX instance being destructed twice (see
	  "Crash in osgviewerWX" of June 12th on osg-users). At program
	  exit, the main frame deletes all of its children widgets and
	  therefore calls GraphicsWindowWX's destructor, bypassing OSG's
	  reference counting. The GraphicsWindowWX instance is then later
	  destructed a second time when the reference held by osg::Camera
	  goes to zero. This bug isn't exposed by the example directly, but
	  if people are going to use the example as a basis (like the
	  poster in the mentioned thread) they very likely will run into
	  this problem.
	  "

2008-06-19 13:28  robert

	* Updated wrappers to fix OpenThreads::Atomic build issues.

2008-06-19 12:02  robert

	* From Michael Platings, fixed typo error in renderbin assignment

2008-06-19 11:58  robert

	* In Program::PerContextProgram changed const Uniform* to
	  osg::ref_ptr<const Uniform*> to avoid the possibility of a
	  uniform being deleted
	  and another being created and assigned at the same address which
	  previously confused the uniform tracking code and introduced a
	  bug.

2008-06-19 11:09  robert

	* From Michael Platings and Robert Osfield, added support for
	  controlling,
	  via StateSet::setNestedRenderBin(bool) whether the new RenderBin
	  should be nested
	  with the existing RenderBin, or be nested with the enclosing
	  RenderStage.

2008-06-18 20:27  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-18 20:24  robert

	* From Michael Platings, implemented check against max number of
	  supported samples to ensure that the number of samples is safely
	  capped to what the hardware is capable of, avoiding GL errors and
	  graceful fallback

2008-06-18 20:17  robert

	* From Liang Aibin:
	  
	  "1. Location: <OSG_SOURCE_ROOT>\src\osgPlugins\osg\Fog.cpp

2008-06-18 12:01  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When copying a node that had uniforms
	  on it, the copy constructor of osg::Uniform would not copy the
	  array of the original uniform (either _intArray or _floatArray)
	  because none had been allocated and the copy constructor checks
	  that *both* this's array and rhs's array are valid.
	  
	  I added a call to allocateDataArray() if rhs has (at least) one
	  valid array, which should allocate the right array according to
	  the type. Since the type was copied from rhs, it should create
	  the same array as rhs has, so then it should copy the data in the
	  following lines.

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "fix to reading of DatabasePath

2008-06-06 16:28  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "I'm using an IntersectionVisitor with a
	  PagedLOD database, employing a ReadCallback to allow the
	  intersector to traverse the paged nodes. I discovered that if the
	  visitor is unable (for any reason) to load a subtile via the
	  ReadCallback, the intersection fails. However, I had the
	  requirement to "fall back" on the lower-resolution parent tile
	  and settle for that intersection.
	  
	  This was easy to implement simply by overriding
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(PagedLOD). My question is: Are there
	  any opinions on whether this should be the default behavior? If
	  it makes sense, I will submit the change; if not, no worries."

2008-06-06 16:25  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here's an updated include/osgText/Text3D that
	  forces recomputation of the glyph repr when the character depth

	  This caused a Text3D object read from a .osg file to not have the
	  correct depth."

2008-06-06 14:59  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I have made the logo plugin work again (a

	* Ran merge to get rid of tabs

2008-06-03 11:31  robert

	* From Marco Lehmann and Robert Osfield, this fix was implemented
	  by Robert but
	  is based on suggested fix from Marco for fixing a crash due to
	  lack of
	  thread safety in std::ofstream("/dev/null"); The fix is to use a
	  custom stream
	  buffer that just discards all data. The implementation is also
	  twice as fast
	  as the old /dev/null based approach.

2008-06-03 11:28  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-05-30 16:53  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "This is a fix for the warning we've
	  been discussing on osg-users. CMake 2.6.0 allows quotes to be
	  unescaped in strings in ADD_DEFINITIONS statements, where we had
	  to escape them before (CMake 2.4.x). Setting CMake policy CMP0005
	  to OLD removes the warning for 2.6.0, and the quotes are still

2008-05-28 13:51  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "The PNG plugin crashes when you try to
	  read a malformed file (attached
	  is an example). This can happen in circumstances that are not
	  manageable by the OSG itself (e.g. 3rd party buggy program) but
	  one
	  would expect the plugin to be able to recover by returning
	  ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE.
	  
	  libpng provides two callbacks for warnings and errors - those are
	  currently unused. By default, they point to function that call
	  exit()
	  or something similar (the default error callback never returns).
	  This
	  patch registers the callbacks using libpng's mechanisms, makes
	  the
	  warning callback emit an osg::notify(osg::WARN) message and the
	  error
	  callback throw an error. The reading process is enclosed in a
	  try...catch block. Upon error, the memory is freed and
	  ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE is returned.

2008-05-28 13:45  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "On Windows, when setting a cursor
	  through
	  osgViewer::GraphicsWindow::setCursor() the new cursor type is
	  recorded
	  but not applied until windows sends another WM_SETCURSOR message.
	  This
	  delays the application of the cursor to the next mouse event.
	  
	  The attached file fixes this by setting the new cursor with a
	  call to
	  ::SetCursor() immediately.

2008-05-28 13:01  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "Yes it's definitely a driver problem - I
	  submitted a bug report to
	  nvidia 6 months ago and the issue is still "in progress". I've
	  given up
	  waiting for them!
	  
	  Platform - various Intel Windows XP SP2 PCs with various nvidia
	  cards
	  including GeForce 8800 GTS and Quadro FX 4500, and various driver
	  versions including the latest WHQL 175.16.
	  
	  I investigated your concerns about glGenerateMipmapEXT being
	  slower than
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS, and for power-of-two textures, to my
	  surprise
	  it is. For a 512*512 texture, glGenerateMipmapEXT takes on
	  average 10ms,
	  while GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS takes on average 6ms. Therefore I
	  have
	  modified the code to only use glGenerateMipmapEXT if the texture
	  has a
	  non-power-of-two width or height. I am resubmitting all the files
	  previously submitted (only "Texture.cpp" has significant changes
	  since
	  my previous submission, I've also replaced tabs with spaces in
	  "Texture").

	* From Mathieu Marache,
	  
	  first post:
	  
	  "I had the problem that debug and release version of the plugins
	  had the same name under linux. These minors modification to
	  Registry and the CMake support files enable to have both Release
	  and Debug version of the plugins to coexist and be found by there
	  respective runtimes."
	  
	  follow up post:
	  
	  "I've gone ahead and added a preprocessor directive with the
	  editable CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX. I modified Registry.cpp to take
	  this new preprocessor directive called OSG_DEBUG_POSTFIX while
	  looking for libraries in Debug mode for the windows (msvc) and
	  the linux platforms.
	  
	  MinGW, cygwin and Apple are still left out this proposal."
	  
	  
	  Notes from Robert Osfield, completed the work in change d entries
	  to use OSG_DEBUG_POSTFIX

2008-05-28 11:58  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-28 11:19  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "On nvidia cards mipmap generation for
	  non-power-of-two textures with
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS is very slow (over half a second for a
	  720*576
	  texture). However, glGenerateMipmapEXT() performs well (16ms for
	  the
	  same texture), so I have modified the attached files to use
	  Texture::generateMipmap() if glGenerateMipmapEXT is supported,
	  instead
	  of enabling & disabling GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS."
	  
	  Notes, from Robert Osfield, I've tested the out of the previous
	  path using
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS and non power of two textures on NVidia
	  7800GT and
	  Nvidia linux drivers with the image size 720x576 and only get
	  compile times
	  of 56ms, so the above half second speed looks to be a driver bug.
	  With
	  Muchael's changes the cost goes done to less than 5ms, so it's
	  certainly
	  an effective change, even given that Michael's poor expereiences
	  with
	  GL_GENERATE_MIP_SGIS do look to be a driver bug.

2008-05-27 20:53  robert

	* From Brad Anderegg, "This submission fixes two bugs and helps
	  some performance problems we have been having with txp databases.
	  
	  
	  
	  The first bug is that the terrain tiles will page out to a lower
	  LOD when they are right in front of you. The issue appears to be
	  with the blacklisting heuristic which forces a tile to LOD 1,
	  commenting out the usage of blacklisting with the LOD Nodes fixes
	  our problem. This code change was made to line 29 of
	  TXPPageLOD.cpp.
	  
	  
	  
	  The second bug we were experiencing is that the database reader
	  options never make it through to the archive loader. The use case
	  for us appeared when the FID codes for the terrain were no longer
	  on the materials. As it turns out the archive was being created
	  twice, once by TXPNode and once by the ReaderWriterTXP on
	  getArchive() so the options never actually got set on the archive
	  that was being loaded. The fix is to first create the archive by
	  calling getArchive on the ReaderWriterTXP, which stores it in a
	  map for reference later, and then passing that archive into the
	  TXPNode for it to set its internal member. With this code change
	  we only create one archive (not sure what creating two did) and
	  our options flags get set properly on the database.
	  
	  
	  
	  The changes made are in TXPNode.h line 72 where the TXPArchive is
	  now passed in. In the TXPNode.cpp the loadArchive(TXPArchive*)
	  was changed to have the default behavior if NULL is passed in, if
	  an archive is passed in then it does not load it since all the
	  loading is done in the ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive(). The only
	  other place that loadArchive is called is in TXPIO.cpp where a
	  modification was made to pass in NULL which will have the same
	  behavior as it used to. The last change is the little block of
	  code starting on line 57 of ReaderWriterTXP.cpp, this was changed
	  so that it first calls getArchive() which caches the archives in
	  a map does some loading stuff and returns a pointer to it which
	  is then passed in as a parameter to TXPNode::loadArchive().
	  
	  
	  
	  The performance changes were made to TXPParser.cpp line 163 where
	  we use to osgUtil::Optimizer on the node before passing it off,
	  and on line 1456 we changed the geometry to use display lists.
	  These small changes actually made drastic performance increases
	  for us, as much as 1000% on certain laptops.
	  
	  
	  
	  As far as testing goes, we have tested these changes with at
	  least 5 txp databases on a variety of different computers
	  including Mac OS and Linux. The base version used is 2.4."

2008-05-27 17:42  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "By default it's the normal behaviour, it
	  means it's "d" extension for debug library and executable. But if
	  you want to change that you can.
	  The reason is if you want to build an application that use a
	  library that use openscenegraph you have to build the full chain
	  in debug or in release.
	  On windows you have no choice, but on linux you can link with
	  both version without rebuilding everything ...
	  
	  The patch consist only to change the line on one line
	  SET(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX "d")
	  with
	  SET(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX "d" CACHE STRING "add a postfix, usually

	* Reorginized the TerrainTile/TerrainTechnique dirty mechanism so
	  that TerrainTile
	  now holds the dirty flag and enables/disables event traversal in

	  being set/unset. This allows terrain to be automatically updated
	  in response
	  to Terrain scale and sample ratio changes.

2008-05-27 15:28  robert

	* Introduced a TerrainHandler that adjust the sameple ratio and

	  respecitvely.

2008-05-27 13:11  robert

	* From John Vidar Larring, "Added vertical scale as a property of

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've refactored the single
	  ReadedWriterVRML2.cpp into multiple files. The reason for doing
	  this was to break up the horribly long function
	  
	  osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node>
	  ReaderWriterVRML2::convertFromVRML(openvrml::node *obj)
	  
	  The fixes are:
	  
	  * Added the source's parent directory as search directory for
	  image files.
	  * The material properties are now set in the stateset of the
	  Geode rather than the Geometry. This will allow geometries to be
	  reused with different material properties in future updates.
	  
	  NB: I planned for a caching scheme in which multiple occurences
	  of the same primitive (e.g., Cylinders with radius 0.8 and height
	  1.2), would use the same Geometry object. Unfortunately, my
	  planning moved me to other areas, but I might still finish the
	  caching scheme in a quiet hour. For the time being I decided it
	  would be a good thing to already submit my current changes.

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch that fix the strange
	  bug describe on the osg-user group.
	  Finally it seems to not come from the empty geode. The origin of
	  the problem seems to be the uniform initialization during the
	  building of the program which call a glUseProgram.
	  If your scene never display the node that contains the shader and
	  if there is no other shader on the scene, this "glUseProgram" is
	  the only one that is called during your simulation. So, this
	  shader is applied on all the scene.
	  
	  I fix this bug by switching off the shader (by calling
	  glUseProgram(0) ) during the compilation of a state which does
	  not contain the shader.

	  AVI and MOVs, and much more efficient sometimes.
	  
	  Changes includes:
	  1. A new GifImageStream class (inherit from osg::ImageStream and
	  OpenThreads::Thread) have already been added to implement
	  different operations of a GIF movie, such like playing, pausing,
	  rewinding, setting time and so on.
	  2. Some small changes to decode_row() and gif_read_stream(),
	  which make the transparency of GIF images correctly.
	  3. Just a few changes to the ReaderWriterGIF::readGIFStream()
	  function, which ensure that animate GIFs are loaded by
	  GifImageStream (and the function returns GifImageStream objects)
	  and static GIFs unchanged (still use the old method and returns
	  osg::Image objects!).
	  
	  Attachments are the cpp file and an animate GIF file for further
	  test. Just rebuild the osgdb_gif project and use osgviewer or
	  osgmovie to view it.
	  The plugin has been tested on Windows and Arch Linux."

	* From Philip Lowman, post 1:
	  
	  "Here is a collection of changes which should fix issues building
	  the OSG with CMake 2.6.0 (along with some other changes)
	  
	  CMakeLists.txt:
	  * Set CMP0003 to supress warning about linking against -lpthread
	  (which is a
	  non-absolute library location). (CMake 2.6.x fix)
	  * Modified the WIN32_USE_MP and a couple of other Visual Studio
	  specific flags
	  to be in an IF(MSVC) block (minor tweak to reduce exposing this
	  stuff on MinGW builds)
	  * Includes my second set of glu tesselator autodetection changes
	  that you
	  seemed to want but haven't committed yet.
	  
	  src/OpenThreads/pthreads/CMakeLists.txt:
	  * Eliminates warning when compiling on Linux about spaces in link
	  line (CMake 2.6.x fix)
	  
	  CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake:
	  * Tweaks to make the macros behave properly under CMake 2.6.0
	  (doesn't change behavior under CMake 2.4.x)
	  
	  CMakeModules/Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake:
	  * Adds the NO_DEFAULT_PATH option to all of the search options so
	  that things in C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph aren't accidently
	  picked up during configure time and instead only things in the
	  "3rdParty" folder are discovered. (general bugfix)
	  "
	  
	  post 2:
	  "Ok, hold the presses. I just discovered that for some odd reason
	  the osgdb_* plugins under Linux aren't getting put under the
	  osgPlugins-2.5.0 folder. Not exactly sure why this broke, the
	  folder was there, just empty. I'll have to look into it this
	  evening."
	  
	  post 3:
	  
	  "Fixed, was caused by the switch to
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and some code in
	  osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt that effectively overrides
	  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH on non-MSVC compilers to dump the plugins in
	  the plugins folder. I tweaked it to override
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as well. Seems to work fine."

2008-05-26 22:34  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "When exporting a DrawArrays PrimitiveSet, the
	  DAE plugin computes an incorrect nbVerticesPerPoly if the first
	  index is not zero. The issue can be reproduced easily with:
	  osgconv cessna.osg cessna.dae
	  
	  Examination of the resulting .dae file reveals several
	  out-of-range tristrip indices; viewing the .dae file in osgviewer
	  causes a crash when OSG tries to lookup those indices.
	  
	  Attached resolves this issue."

2008-05-26 21:53  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "I've attached a patch for the Texture2DArray
	  which solves problems of loading image data into the texture
	  array. So here are a small description:
	  
	  - Solves issues of loading image data into the texture memory
	  - Print a warning if images are of different dimensions or have
	  different internal formats (GL specification requires images to
	  be the same)
	  
	  
	  Patch is tested and seems to work fine. It shouldn't break any
	  other functionality. It should go into include/osg and src/osg
	  "

2008-05-26 21:44  robert

	* Fixed copyright notice typo

2008-05-26 21:33  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached code changes StateSet::merge() so
	  that it copies RenderBin data such as the rendering hint and
	  RenderBin details from rhs into "this", only if "this" has
	  RenderBin mode set to INHERIT.
	  
	  It replaces a comment by you indicating something along these
	  lines should be done. To me, this seems like the right thing to
	  do."

2008-05-26 21:32  robert

	* From Gino, "According to the 1.4.1 COLLADA spec (2nd ed) the
	  standard behavior for fx_sampler_wrap_common is as follows
	  
	  CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
	  NONE->GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER
	  
	  The current 2.5.0 daePlugin assumes the following binding
	  
	  CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP
	  NONE->GL_REPEAT
	  
	  Notably the GL_CLAMP binding will result in visible black seams
	  on input files that use otherwise matching textures. Replacing
	  GL_CLAMP by GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE solves this problem. I've updated
	  both the read and write functions.
	  "

2008-05-26 21:18  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "I changed the test name to be a little
	  easier to understand and defaulted Linux & Windows builds to
	  false and to skip the compile check as you desired.
	  "

2008-05-26 21:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-26 21:09  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an update to the osgviewerWX example.
	  Keyboard events were not always received because the
	  GraphicsWindowWX wasn't receiving focus. It now receives focus
	  when the mouse enters the window.
	  * I split the mouse handling from a monolithic method to separate
	  ones, slightly cleaner than a whole bunch of if()'s, especially
	  with another case of the mouse entering the canvas.
	  * I changed the EVT_KEY_DOWN handler to an EVT_CHAR handler,
	  although that now makes the up and down handler assymetric. The
	  new down-handler returns translated key codes, so when you press
	  the S key (without anything else), it actually returns 's' and
	  not 'S' as the EVT_KEY_DOWN did. This means that statistics can
	  be called up in the viewer window, while the example previously
	  only printed a "Stats output:" line to the console. I'm not truly
	  happy that the up handler returns _untranslated_ key codes. But
	  solving this completely would probably mean adding some table
	  that translated from wxWidgets' untranslated key codes to OSG's
	  internal ones. This might be interesting to add, as anyone using
	  OSG + wxWidgets in any serious manner would also have to add
	  this.
	  * I commented out the evt.Skip()'s in the keyboard handlers as
	  these would only be necessary if there were some key events that
	  are not handled. But currently all key events are simply
	  forwarded.
	  * I changed the handling of a mouse drag to a more general mouse
	  move"

2008-05-26 21:04  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I had to tighten a declaration in
	  OpenFlight/FltWriteResult.h, as the Solaris SunStudio 11 compiler
	  was being picky and wouldn't compile."

2008-05-26 20:46  robert

	* Added debug block to output the location of the master camera for
	  each View in a Viewer.

2008-05-26 17:30  robert

	* Added continuous recording of the animation path to the
	  RecordAnimationPathHandler

2008-05-26 16:25  robert

	* Introduce --pbuffer-only width height option, and added fps
	  reporting to stats output

2008-05-26 15:41  robert

	* Added basic --pbuffer width height support

2008-05-26 14:30  robert

	* Added better stats reporting

2008-05-26 12:01  robert

	* Added feedback of pixel format chosen for read back

2008-05-26 11:59  robert

	* Added automatic selection of the pixel type according to the
	  window type

2008-05-26 11:53  robert

	* Added option for doing triple buffering, and set the default read
	  format
	  to GL_RGBA

2008-05-25 22:06  robert

	* Switch to using an inital draw callback when use --start-frame

2008-05-25 21:52  robert

	* Added option for setting whether the front or back buffer should
	  be read using
	  --front and --back command line options.

2008-05-25 21:35  robert

	* Added option for controlling whether the front buffer is read at
	  the start of the
	  frame or the back buffer at the end of the frame.

2008-05-25 11:21  robert

	* Added check for pkg-config so that build only use related package
	  checks when
	  it's supported

2008-05-24 11:05  robert

	* Added #define's for PixelBufferObject extensions.
	  
	  Added docs for Camera::DrawCallback

2008-05-24 09:24  robert

	* Added RenderStage::setClear*() methods from Camera::getClear*()
	  sources

2008-05-24 08:13  robert

	* Changed default format to GL_BGR

2008-05-23 16:26  robert

	* Added single buffered and double buffered PBO support, and
	  --no-pbo,
	  --single-pbo and --double-pbo command line parameters

2008-05-22 17:50  robert

	* Added basic glReadPixels code

2008-05-22 15:43  robert

	* Added camera final callback attachment code.

2008-05-22 13:11  robert

	* Fixed name of source file

2008-05-22 13:10  robert

	* Added new osgscreencapture example folder, implementation to
	  follow

2008-05-22 12:38  robert

	* Reorginaized the DatabaseQueue's to avoid warnings under Windows

2008-05-22 11:21  robert

	* Fixed warning by adding in missing return

2008-05-22 08:31  robert

	* Checking in missed header

2008-05-21 21:09  robert

	* Refactored DatabasePager and related classes to introduce support
	  for
	  multi-threaded paging, where the Pager manages threads of reading
	  local
	  and http files via seperate threads. This makes it possible to
	  smoothly
	  browse large databases where parts of the data are locally cached
	  while
	  others are on a remote server. Previously with this type of
	  dataset
	  the pager would stall all paging while http requests were being
	  served,
	  even when parts of the models are still loadable virtue of being
	  in the
	  local cache.
	  
	  Also as part of the refactoring the DatabaseRequest are now
	  stored in the
	  ProxyNode/PagedLOD nodes to facilitate quite updating in the cull
	  traversal,
	  with the new code avoiding mutex locks and searches. Previous on
	  big
	  databases the overhead involved in make database requests could
	  accumulate
	  to a point where it'd cause the cull traversal to break frame.
	  The overhead
	  now is negligable.
	  
	  Finally OSG_FILE_CACHE support has been moved from the curl
	  plugin into
	  the DatabasePager. Eventually this functionality will be moved
	  out into
	  osgDB for more general usage.

2008-05-20 09:28  robert

	* Moved the compile to after the updateSceneView

2008-05-14 20:22  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-14 17:03  robert

	* Introduced preliminary support for asynchronous file read
	  requests,
	  
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult now has a FILE_REQUEST enum.
	  ReaderWriter::Options now has a s/getAsynchronousFileReadHint()
	  parameter methods.
	  
	  libcurl based plugin now detects enabing of the
	  AsynchronousFileReadHint, but
	  as yet does not handle async requests - handling everything
	  syncronously.
	  
	  DatabasePager now by default will enable AsynchronousFileReadHint
	  for http
	  based file requests
	  

2008-05-14 14:59  robert

	* Moved the cache file writing into StreamObject so that the cache
	  file is only
	  created once data is being read.

2008-05-14 13:16  robert

	* Introduced a thread safe map which manages a single EasyCurl
	  object per thread.

2008-05-14 12:47  robert

	* Refactor curl usage so that a new EasyCurl class wraps up the
	  curl handle and
	  reading from curl.

2008-05-13 18:28  robert

	* Fixed lat/long ordering

2008-05-13 17:27  robert

	* Added support for -e level minX minY maxX maxY extents controls

2008-05-13 14:08  robert

	* Added --file-cache directoryname command line option support to
	  readNodeFiles(ArgumentParser&)
	  to make it easier to specify a local file cache, in place of the
	  default OSG_FILE_CACHE
	  env var.

2008-05-13 12:36  robert

	* Further work on computing of lat/long range of PagedLOD subgraphs

2008-05-13 10:56  robert

	* From Steven Thomas, "Subject: Collada fix
	  There was a problem converting a file to Collada by using osgconv
	  like this:
	  
	  osgconv file.osg file.dae
	  
	  You would get an error message:
	  
	  I/O error : Permission denied
	  I/O error : Permission denied
	  error : xmlNewTextWriterFilename : out of memory!
	  Error: daeLIBXMLPlugin::write(file://cessna.dae) failed
	  Warning: Error in writing to "cessna.dae".
	  
	  This was due to some bad URI processing code in the Collada
	  plugin. The attached file fixes this by using the Collada DOM's
	  URI processing functions. After this change the file will convert
	  successfully in the local directory.
	  "

2008-05-12 16:59  robert

	* Added signal handling code, and prelimary lat/long computation

2008-05-12 15:42  robert

	* Added missing getBound() method

2008-05-12 12:16  robert

	* Update ChangeLog and wrappers for 2.5.0 dev release

2008-05-12 12:16  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS for 2.5.0 release

2008-05-12 11:39  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Fixed FrameBufferObject attachement code
	  to handle cases
	  where no texture or image is attached

2008-05-12 11:01  robert

	* Updated version number for 2.5.0 dev release

2008-05-12 10:55  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski and Robert Osfield, moved command line
	  option usage setup
	  from osgviewer example into osg::ArgumentParser and
	  osgViewer::Viewer to make
	  them more universally available.

2008-05-12 10:18  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "* add easy multiple texture targets support for
	  obj by refactoring texture
	  load into it's own method.
	  
	  * use new method from step 1 to load 'map_opacity' textures from
	  .mtl files"

2008-05-12 10:16  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, fixed typo

2008-05-11 14:26  robert

	* Added CARIO_FOUND into svg plugins checks

2008-05-11 14:23  robert

	* From Miguel Escriva, Here you will find a SVG Image Reader. It
	  renders a SVG file as an osg::Image using cairo and rsvg.

2008-05-10 17:25  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change adds support for osg::Billboards to
	  the OpenFlight exporter.
	  
	  It might seem odd that the change actually removes the stub
	  apply(Billboard&) method, but it turns out Billboards are easily
	  supported in subordinate routines of the existing apply(Geode&)
	  method with s dynamic_cast, so there's no need for a separate
	  apply(Billboard&)."

2008-05-10 17:23  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Another round of plugin enhancements.
	  
	  3DC: Output now uses osg::notify.
	  JPEG: Now returns correct error code for empty input file.
	  FreeType: Prevent possible crash if Options is NULL."

2008-05-10 17:04  robert

	* Moved compile setup from osgViewer::ViewerBase into
	  osgViewer::Renderer to
	  avoid threading issues associated with compile running in a
	  parallel with
	  update/cull on the first frame.
	  
	  Also added automatic recompile when a new SceneData is applied to
	  a View.

2008-05-09 17:22  robert

	* Added --file-cache command line option to compliment -c

2008-05-09 17:08  robert

	* Initial cut of file cache population app

2008-05-09 11:54  robert

	* From Art Trevs, set the _geometryVerticesOut to default to 1 as a
	  workaround
	  for OpenGL driver bug that incorrectly reports a warning when
	  value is 0.

2008-05-09 11:27  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Attached are some minor plugin fixes. PNM, RGB,
	  and JPEG would all crash if attempting to read an empty file, and
	  FLT would go into an infinite loop. All are fixed with this
	  change.
	  
	  I also fixed some return values for a couple of these, changing
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED to ERROR_IN_READING_FILE where appropriate."

2008-05-09 10:27  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, fixed window resize problem

2008-05-08 17:02  robert

	* Added missing check against handling invalid bounding sphere's

2008-05-08 16:48  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I found one compilation error in OSG 2.4
	  in the Inventor plugin, where one node (SoTextureCoordinate3) was
	  assumed to be available in all versions of Inventor but is
	  actually only available in Coin. The use of the node is now
	  protected by #ifdef __COIN__ constructs. The attachment is based
	  on OSG 2.4, not SVN."

2008-05-08 16:45  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "In KDE I switch desktops with Super-Tab,
	  and occasionally I
	  get an excess Tab key report when switching back to an OSG
	  application (usually FlightGear :-). Although KDE has consumed
	  the Tab, it's sometimes still in the XKeymapEvent's key_vector,
	  and followed by a Tab KeyRelease event.
	  
	  Avoid this artifact by
	  - asking for a "fresh" keymap (via XQueryKeymap()), rather than
	  using the unreliable(?) XKeymapEvent's key_vector, and by
	  - flushing all key events on focus-in (to avoid the KeyRelease)
	  
	  After Super-press, Tab-press, Super-release, Tab-release (note
	  the wrong release order!) I still get an extra Tab event. But
	  this is not surprising and not exactly wrong either. Also it's
	  hard to avoid, as we can't see what happened to the keyboard
	  before we regained focus.
	  
	  Files changed:
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11"

2008-05-08 16:39  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, osgviewerGTK example

2008-05-08 15:17  robert

	* From Sebastien Messerschmidt, "attached you'll find a patch for
	  the shp-plugin.
	  I've spotted huge memory leaks int ShapeParser and fixed them.
	  Also, there was a missing destructor (PolygonM) and a missing
	  member initialization (PolygonZ)
	  Would be nice if someone could test the changes.
	  
	  To release the memory just if no reading error happened (and
	  therefore the arrays would be valid) I've added an macro to
	  release and reset the pointers at once. I'm not using macros
	  myself very often as I don't like them, but I think it doesn't
	  hurt in this code.
	  
	  "

2008-05-08 15:14  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and osgversion to catch Raymond de Vries name
	  correctly

2008-05-08 14:00  robert

	* From Raymond de Vries, "This fix tests the right variable before
	  it is allocated. Fortunately, until now it tested another
	  variable (_particleSizeUniform, which is, at that moment, not
	  allocated as well) and everything went ok. So it does not fix a
	  crash or so, it is a matter of correct code.
	  
	  Line 353 is changed from
	  
	  if (!_particleSizeUniform)
	  
	  to
	  
	  if (!_particleColorUniform)
	  "

2008-05-08 13:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "As I discovered prior to the 2.4 release, the
	  FLT export geometry backend was using some old turn-on code,
	  originally written just to enable other development but not
	  intended for actual release. Sadly, my OSG training commitments
	  prevented me from fixing this prior to 2.4.
	  
	  In essence, the FLT exporter was emitting a full set of Mesh
	  records each time it encountered a PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  Attached is a fix. The code now emits the Mesh set up records,
	  then iterates over all PrimitiveSets and emits a Mesh Primitive
	  record per PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  It also loops over PrimitiveSets twice, first writing Face
	  records according to the mode, the writing Mesh records (again
	  according to the mode).
	  
	  The final change included here is support for GL_POINTS as
	  single-vertex Face records.
	  
	  Billboards are still to come."

	* From Philip Lowman, "Attached is a patch to the toplevel

2008-04-17 15:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a refactored and
	  improved quicktime-plugin. I moved all code related to the
	  image-loading, swizzling etc into an extra class. The quicktime
	  plugin supports now reading and writing images from/to streams
	  and the code is less cluttered than previous versions.
	  
	  I removed QTtexture.h/.cpp and added QTImportExport.h/.cpp. I
	  updated the CMake-files, I hope they are alright. I used the
	  submitted code in my own apps since two months or so and it seems
	  pretty stable, but as always the migration to the osg-quicktime
	  plugin may have introduced new bugs, so perfect for developer
	  release :)"

2008-04-16 15:23  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "he attached are conversions of the 3 main
	  places i found in osg where tokens are used to represent bitmasks
	  with 'magic' numbers, like 32. i've changed these to a more
	  representative bitshift representation, showing clearly in which
	  bit you can expect this token to manifest. ie, converted things
	  like:
	  
	  from: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 8,
	  to: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 1<<3,
	  
	  showing clearly that this isn't the _value_ 8, but the _bit_ 8.
	  this is an old pattern i see (and like to promulgate) to make
	  code a bit more readable and maintainable.
	  "

2008-04-16 15:22  robert

	* Updated version number for nex dev release

2008-04-15 20:16  robert

2008-04-15 19:46  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "The following changes fix the flickering
	  issue I'm seeing when trying to externally manage my cursor in
	  Win32. If you set the cursor to InheritCursor,
	  GraphicsWindowWin32 ignores WM_SETCURSOR and assumes you will set
	  the cursor yourself."

2008-04-15 19:36  robert

	* From Art Trevs, moved multile render targets support from
	  RenderStage into FrameBufferObject.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, refactored the

	  within the setAttachment method to avoid potential
	  threading/execution order issues.

	* From Christian Kaser, "I discovered a bug that lead to a space
	  being displayed at the start of the new line after an automatic
	  line break (through setMaximumWidth()). The fix simply skips all
	  spaces at the end of the line, before skipping a line break which
	  was done already.
	  
	  osgText/Text.cpp: Line 502
	  ...
	  else
	  {
	  ++itr;
	  }
	  
	  if (itr!=_text.end())
	  {
	  // skip over spaces and return.
	  while (*itr==' ') ++itr; // New
	  if (*itr=='\n') ++itr;

	  // move to new line.
	  switch(_layout)

2008-04-11 13:43  robert

	* From Paul Martz,"Several misc changes, but the major fixes
	  include:
	  
	  * Support for Vec4ubArray for color data
	  * Support for material transparency
	  
	  Thanks to Neil Hughes, Jason Daly, yourself, and others for
	  testing and reporting issues."

2008-04-11 13:28  robert

	* From Philipp Machler, "We have extended the support for Wacom
	  Tablet devices:
	  
	  - Mac OS X
	  - not only pressure, but tilt and z-rotation is supported now
	  "

2008-04-11 13:04  robert

	* Added reference to osgstereomatch example to
	  osgmultiplerendertargets.
	  
	  Added usage example use OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images examples

2008-04-11 13:03  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Here is a patch for cmakelists.txt to add
	  support for the /MP option
	  in Microsoft compilers as discussed in osg-users. There is now an
	  advanced option called WIN32_USE_MP (which defaults to OFF) that
	  will
	  enable the /MP switch for all builds. I tucked this code block
	  safely
	  within a IF(WIN32) branch."

2008-04-11 11:58  robert

	* From Jose Delport, a MRT example implementing stereo matching.

2008-04-11 11:19  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-04-11 11:10  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "The GUIEventAdapter header file had
	  KeySymbols for the super and
	  hyper keys defined already, but these modifiers were missing in
	  GUIEventAdapter::ModKeyMask, and the EventQueue ingored them as
	  well.
	  
	  The attached diff/archive adds the missing parts for Super/Hyper
	  modifier key support.
	  
	  
	  I'm aware that this might not be supported on all
	  systems/keyboards
	  out of the box, but decided to submit it anyway because:
	  
	  - developers are aware of differences between input devices
	  (Some mice have scroll wheels, others don't. Some have five or
	  more buttons, some have only one. Some keyboards don't have
	  numpads, some have AltGr, some don't etc.)
	  
	  - even if someone relies on Hyper/Super in distributed software,
	  this is easy to fix and doesn't create lock-in conditions
	  
	  - while the names Hyper/Super may only be common on X11, they are
	  just symbol names and not OS-specific
	  
	  - even though some systems might not offer these additional
	  modifiers
	  by default, it's likely that all of them have at least 8 modifier
	  levels internally, so it should only be a matter of OS
	  configuration
	  to make them work
	  
	  - having super/hyper available is useful to offer a user ways
	  to define local key definitions that are safe from collisions
	  with
	  predefined "official" key assignments"

2008-04-11 10:58  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Modified the cmakelists.txt file for the
	  curl plugin so the proper
	  linker directories are set in Win32. The old cmakelists.txt would
	  set
	  the lib release folder for debug builds as well. This should
	  correct
	  that."

2008-04-11 10:31  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, fixed typo.

2008-04-11 10:30  robert

	* From Benoit Laniel, "I use mingw to cross-compile openscenegraph
	  to win32. However, linux
	  filesystem is case-sensitive. Here are the modifications needed
	  to make
	  the compiler happy. These are only some include lines rewritten
	  (Io.h to
	  io.h, Windows.h to windows.h etc.) for version 2.3.7."

2008-04-11 10:16  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "1) add simplifier command "--simplifier .5" to
	  reduce complexity
	  2) complementarily add a "--overallNormal" to replace
	  per-vert/per-facet normals with an overall. simplifier doesn't
	  work
	  in certain cases without less complex normals. this gets that
	  done.
	  3) add env var output with full verbose output so people realize
	  it's
	  active when the app is run - i see this all the time in training
	  where
	  people run osgconv, with unintended data transformations due to
	  osgUtil:;Optimzer, for example"

2008-04-11 10:10  robert

	* Added --mouse option to enable mouse tracking, and fixed bug in
	  assumption
	  that nv is not null.

2008-04-03 18:36  robert

	* Introduced CMake build option for compiling double or float
	  versions of osg::BoundingSphere and osg::BoundingBox.
	  
	  Introduced code in BoundgingSphere, BoundingBox, ProxyNode and
	  LOD to utilise the above settings.
	  
	  Added Matrix::value_type, Plane::value_type,
	  BoundingSphere::value_type and BoundingBox::value_type command
	  line
	  options that report where the types of floats or doubles.

2008-04-03 18:06  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The X11WindowingSystemInterface in
	  osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  unconditionally sets the X11 error handler routine, replacing
	  anything
	  that was previously set. This is a bit unfriendly, as the X11
	  error
	  handler is a global attribute which the application, or the GUI
	  toolkit
	  being used, may well have set itself.
	  
	  So I have modified X11WindowingSystemInterface to only replace
	  the error
	  handler if it is the default i.e. if the application has not set
	  it."

2008-04-03 10:26  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "While using the dds plugin (via osgdem) it
	  was able to write 24bit
	  images with BGR order but not read them. My 2-liner fixed it for
	  me
	  but it may be that someone with more knowledge of the plugin want
	  to
	  insert more pixel formats in the reading part of the plugin."

2008-04-02 17:08  robert

	* From Jose Delport, added support for MRT via glDrawBuffers

2008-04-02 13:57  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Subject: osga reading slash mismatch
	  requests for files in a archive are made with unix style paths.
	  So to
	  be able to match an entry in map(_indexMap) it's keys needs to be
	  stored in unix style even on Win32"
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfied, simplified this submission so that the
	  added conversion to
	  unix slahes is done on all platforms as this should be safe and
	  simpler to maintain.

2008-04-02 13:55  robert

	* Updated to reflect new COLOR_BUFFER0 value

2008-04-02 13:48  robert

	* From Jose Delport, introduced osgmultiplerendertargets example

2008-04-02 13:47  robert

	* Changed the Camera::BufferComponent::COLOR_BUFFER0 from being
	  equal to COLOR_BUFFER
	  to being COLOR_BUFFER+1 to enable differentation between non MRT
	  and MRT paths.

2008-04-02 11:28  robert

	* From Jose Delport, typo fixes

2008-04-01 17:22  robert

	* Updated data for 2.3.7 dev release

2008-04-01 11:03  robert

	* Updated OpenThreads version to 2.2.1 with the switch of
	  sources/svn:externals from OpenThreads to OpenSceneGraph.

2008-04-01 10:49  robert

	* Moved OpenThreads directly into OpenSceneGraph/trunk rather than
	  being introduced via svn:externals.
	  
	  This change has been done to make it easier for OpenSceneGraph
	  users to check out the svn via https
	  without any conflicts introduced with a http externals.

2008-04-01 10:33  robert

	* Updated version numbers for 2.3.7 dev release

2008-04-01 10:11  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Two changes:
	  - Handle DrawArrays first/count correctly (fixes problem reported
	  by Jason Daly)
	  - Display warning if non-Geometry Drawable is encountered."

2008-04-01 10:00  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka and Stephan Huber, bug fixes and
	  enhancement of cursor suppoort.

2008-03-31 16:23  robert

	* Added checks for a valid scene graph before doing various ops on
	  it.

2008-03-31 14:00  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, build fix for Solaris

2008-03-31 11:44  robert

	* Added Camera::s/getClearAccum, s/getClearStencil and
	  s/getClearDepth.

2008-03-31 09:43  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-29 09:59  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox with a little reorganisation from Robert
	  Osfield, added
	  test for 0 sized subloads, ignoring them to prevent a divide by
	  zero error occuring on some buggy drivers.

2008-03-28 19:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Some small changes and code cleanup. Biggest
	  change is an improvement to the WriteResult return."

2008-03-28 18:42  robert

	* Set Texture::setMaxAnisotropy() to 16.0f for better quality
	  terrain when looking at shallow angle.

2008-03-28 17:53  robert

	* Improved the error capture and reporting

2008-03-28 15:52  robert

	* Rewrote the DatabasePager::removeExpiredSubgraphs(double) routine
	  as it
	  as not expiring subgraphs quick enough to enable reasonable load
	  balancing.
	  
	  New version isn't perfect and will need further work, but does at
	  least reduce
	  the memory footprint by as much as half on test paths on big
	  databases.
	  
	  The rewritten method no longer uses the the
	  MaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs
	  and MinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs variables so these and
	  associated methods
	  for accessing them have been removed.
	  
	  - /** Set the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per
	  frame */
	  - void setMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs(unsigned int number)
	  { _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs = number; }
	  -
	  - /** Get the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per
	  frame */
	  - unsigned int getMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs() const {
	  return _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs; }
	  -
	  - /** Set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep
	  */
	  - void setMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs(unsigned int number) {
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs = number; }
	  -
	  - /** Get the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep
	  */
	  - unsigned int getMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs() const { return
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs; }

2008-03-28 15:31  robert

	* Introduced mutex into Terrain node to manage the tile system data
	  structures

2008-03-28 15:28  robert

	* Reordered set up of scene and event handlers to prevent warning

2008-03-28 13:22  robert

	* Removed old lower case versions

2008-03-28 12:44  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's the mods to the OpenFlight plugin to
	  support FLT export. The ZIP file contains the new .cpp/h files as
	  well as existing files that I modified.
	  
	  Changes to existing files:
	  ReaderWriter.cpp -- to support writeNode() of course.
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp -- to support writeObject -- we write .attr
	  files for textures, if they don't already exist.
	  AttrData.cpp/.h -- Minor fixes.
	  CMakeLists.txt -- to include the new files in the build."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, port to non Windows platforms just required
	  fixing of header capitilization errors
	  that windows lets through the net due to having a case
	  insensitive file system.
	  

2008-03-27 13:21  robert

	* Removed TileSystem class, and added support for TerrainTile's
	  automatically
	  registering and unregistering themseles with the enclosing
	  Terrain node.

2008-03-27 11:56  robert

	* Added wrapper for TerrainTile

	* Introduce TerrainSystem node which decorates a complete terrain
	  model made up of Terrain tiles.

2008-03-26 20:03  robert

	* From Carlo Camporesi, "I have made some changes in order to allow
	  the using of proxies via env variables and options.
	  I have modified also the cmakelist. In this way osg is able to
	  find the library in 3rdParty directory."

2008-03-26 20:01  robert

	* From Carlo Comporesi, adding support of finding libcurl in 3rd
	  party dependencies

2008-03-25 15:21  robert

	* From Tomas Hnilica, "
	  Attached is modified source of AdapterWidget.cpp file from

	  setFocusPolicy(Qt::ClickFocus);
	  Scene disappearing by resizing to minimum still needs to be
	  fixed..."

2008-03-25 13:14  robert

	* Moved include of c headers to top, and remove using std::strlen
	  in an attempt to solve gcc4.3 compile problems

2008-03-25 13:06  robert

	* Added limits.h to try and avoid gcc 4.3 compile problems

2008-03-25 13:01  robert

2008-03-25 12:26  robert

	* Fixed LessGeode operator.

2008-03-25 11:50  robert

	* From Wojciech Leandowski, "I removed few lines of code that were
	  setting Threading mode and Screen mode. I believe they are now
	  not neccessary because the same does osgViewer::Viewer argument
	  parser. In fact argument list does not contain these args after
	  they were parsed by osgViewer::Viewer constructor.
	  
	  I also allowed myself to add ThreadingHandler to the example."

2008-03-24 18:06  robert

	* Added sampling down to 32x32 mesh for 64x64 height fields as a
	  workaround to
	  memory consumption issues with high res whole earth paged
	  databases.

2008-03-24 18:03  robert

	* Added mutex to prevent multiple cull threads changing the
	  MultiTextureControl at one time.

2008-03-24 10:53  robert

	* Added full range of cameras manipulators to
	  osgmultitexturecontrol example

2008-03-23 18:28  robert

	* Added < and > key bindings to allow the speed to be animation
	  speed to be increased or decreased.

2008-03-21 18:35  robert

	* Added preliminary file cache support. Enabled by setting the
	  OSG_FILE_CACHE variable.

2008-03-21 18:31  robert

	* Added missing break; at end of each case entry.

2008-03-21 15:43  robert

	* Added initial cut of libcurl based plugin

2008-03-20 10:24  robert

	* Updated date for 2.4.6 release

2008-03-19 21:05  robert

	* From Melchoir Franz, "osgViewer toggled the NumLock state
	  correctly when pressing the NumLock
	  key, but it didn't pick up the initial state. So, if NumLock was
	  on for
	  the OS at startup (LED on), it was still off for OSG. And the
	  first
	  keypress turned the LED off, and NumLock on for OSG. The attached
	  fix
	  picks up the state on every FocusIn, just like it was done in the
	  last
	  commits for CapsLock. The difference is, that the NumLock mask
	  isn't
	  standardized (e.g. 0x10 for Linux, and 0x80 for AIX), so we have
	  to do
	  a reverse lookup (::rescanModifierMapping()).
	  
	  Note that I could not reproduce the problem on my system, but
	  someone
	  else confirmed it twice on his, and the patch fixed it for him.
	  
	  Changed files:
	  ./include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11
	  ./src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  
	  "

2008-03-19 11:41  robert

	* Revert the Camera::setInheritanceMask(0x) calls that were added
	  as workaround to a bug introduced by a bug fix to the way the
	  inhertiance mask was handled in CullVisito::apply(Camera&)

2008-03-19 11:40  robert

	* Introduced InheritanceMaskActionOnAttributeSetting member to
	  CullSettings, and associated applyMaskAction method that is
	  now used in all CullSettings::set*() methods, which by default
	  helps disable the inheritance mask associated
	  with settings that are made locally.

2008-03-18 17:44  robert

	* Set the CullSettings::InhertianceMask to 0x0 as temporary measure
	  till we
	  work out the best scheme to use w.r.t inhertiance of CullSettins.

2008-03-18 15:48  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-18 15:37  robert

	* To osg::AutoTransform added support for MinimumScale,
	  MaximumScale and AutoScaleTransitionWidth parameters
	  and a new scheme for computing the scaling when using autoscale
	  that introduces smooth
	  transitions to the scaling of the subgraph so that it looks more
	  natural.

2008-03-18 10:45  robert

	* Added example code showing how to set the minimum and maximum
	  scales

2008-03-18 09:17  robert

2008-03-17 12:23  robert

	* Fixed moving model bug where the moving model code was looking
	  for a transform with DataVariance set to DYNAMIC, but the scene
	  graph set up code was leaving the setting to default to STATIC.
	  Fix involved setting DataVariance on moving transoforms to
	  DYNAMIC.

2008-03-17 12:13  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-17 12:11  robert

2008-03-17 12:09  robert

	* Introduce
	  osgParticle::ParticleSystem::s/getParticleScaleReferenceFrame()
	  to
	  help manage the scaling of particles, whether they should be
	  relative to the
	  local coordiante frame of the particle system, or be in world
	  coordinates.

2008-03-17 10:29  robert

	* Added fire effect, enabled by --fire command line option. The new
	  fire effect
	  has been introduced to reproduce the scaling of paricle effects

2008-03-14 15:32  robert

	* Fixed indenting

2008-03-14 15:13  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "Attached is a fix for remaining problems in
	  capslock handling:
	  It sets osgGA's keymask when restoring keys on FocusIn, according
	  to the state values of XKeyEvent and XCrossingEvent. (These are
	  the only source for X11's current capslock state that avoids
	  pulling in the XKB extension.)
	  "

2008-03-14 15:00  robert

	* Missing checkin

2008-03-14 14:35  robert

	* Added iostream include

2008-03-14 13:21  robert

	* Added cloning of the StateSet before modification to work around
	  threading issue
	  relating to the StateSet being modified by the event/update
	  thread and read from
	  the draw thread at the same time.

	* Fixed doc comment

2008-03-13 19:44  robert

	* Removed gl and glu prefixes from SceneGraphBuilder methods to
	  avoid problems under Solaris

2008-03-13 16:40  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added a few fixes to the VRML 2.0
	  plugin:
	  
	  1) Full DOS paths are now correctly opened by OpenVRML. A URL
	  containing
	  a DOS path should be "file:///C:data/blah" rather than
	  "file://C:data/blah".
	  
	  2) The last primitive defined in "coordIndex" is now added if the
	  "coordIndex" is not terminated by -1.
	  
	  3) Smoothed normals are computed if no normal field is provided.
	  Currently, there is no support for "creaseAngle", so all edges
	  (even the
	  ones sharper than the creaseAngle) are smoothed. I might add this
	  in the
	  future if demand rises.
	  
	  4) If an IndexedFaceSet contains only triangles or quads then the
	  primitive type is set to TRIANGLES or QUADS, and the primset
	  becomes
	  DrawArrays rather than DrawArrayLengths.
	  
	  Question: I noticed that for DrawArrays you can still provide an
	  index
	  array. Would the rendering be faster if I'd create DrawElements
	  primsets
	  rather than DrawArrays? Phrased differently, what is the benefit
	  of
	  using DrawElements over DrawArrays, as there is clearly not a
	  one-to-one
	  mapping of these concepts to their OpenGL counterparts?
	  
	  5) Objects are added to the transparent bin and blend mode is
	  enabled
	  only if the transparency is nonzero. Rendered transparent objects
	  no
	  longer write the depth buffer."

2008-03-13 16:38  robert

	* From Jose Delport, "attached is a version of osgunittests that
	  does not give false alarms
	  for the case where q1 = -q2. The output of 'osgunittests quat' is
	  now
	  much cleaner.
	  "

2008-03-13 16:22  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgviewerWX example to bring
	  it more in line with the
	  other GUI toolkit examples. It now takes a model file as
	  command-line
	  argument (complaining if there isn't one), and its startup window
	  size
	  is now actually applied (it used to be too small). I tested this
	  with a
	  unicode-build of wxWidgets, as that is the recommended build type
	  on
	  Linux with GTK. I'm pretty sure this version of the example will
	  work
	  for the ANSI build as well, but I have no way of testing."

2008-03-13 16:18  robert

	* From Melchoir Franz, "ac3d.cpp does currently strip everything
	  but the file name in
	  "texture" paths. This is to drop absolute paths that some
	  3d editors export (even AC3D itself!). But this also strips
	  directories of relative paths, which is wrong and contradicts
	  the ac3d reference implementation. (The reference implementation
	  doesn't strip anything, though, and so takes the absolute paths
	  as they are. Definitely not what we want.)
	  
	  The attached solution checks absolute paths and only strips
	  those:
	  
	  (1) A:\\foo\\bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  (2) /foo/bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  
	  (3) foo/bar.png -> foo/bar.png (new)
	  (4) ../foo/bar.png -> ../foo/bar.png (new)
	  
	  "

2008-03-13 16:12  robert

2008-03-13 16:05  robert

	* Added double versions of intersect methods

2008-03-13 16:05  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-13 15:23  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, "I've taken this another step, to use
	  value_type inside the intersect calls. I did choose to use sqrt()
	  instead of sqrtf()."

2008-03-13 15:21  robert

	* From Paul Martz, files for adding ObjectRecordData support into
	  OpenFlight

2008-03-13 14:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached preserves OpenFlight Object record
	  data as UserData in the osg::Group corresponding to the Object
	  record.
	  
	  The files are:
	  include/osgSim/ObjectRecordData -- The new class. Derives from
	  Object to support .osg IO.
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp -- Reads data into
	  that class.
	  src/osgPlugins/osgSim/IO_ObjectRecordData.cpp -- .osg IO
	  support."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, made the OpenFlight read object record data
	  optional via the -O readObjectRecordData ReaderWriter option.

2008-03-13 13:44  robert

	* Added support for assigning state to created drawables,
	  implemented gluDisk.

2008-03-13 13:43  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "Here I send minor corrections to the text
	  output by the osgforest example when
	  building its graphs. The message "Creating billboard based
	  forest" appears
	  four times regardless of the actual type of the graph being
	  built.
	  "

2008-03-12 20:20  robert

2008-03-11 13:29  robert

	* Added default implementations of new SceneGraphBuilder class

2008-03-11 13:23  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "it appears to me that sun CC cannot use
	  static functions from template
	  functions. The attached change is required to make it compile
	  with sun CC."

2008-03-11 13:19  robert

2008-03-05 11:52  robert

	* From Atr Trevs, added missinging initializers

2008-03-05 11:33  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I changed osgGA::StateSetManipulator
	  to mirror the
	  osgViewer::StatsHandler and other handlers which allow you to
	  change the
	  key(s) you would press to get them to do something. Pretty simple
	  change
	  but useful in our context and possibly in others too."

2008-03-04 17:57  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "
	  The problem can be reproduced by simply changing the osgpick
	  example to
	  use a CompositeViewer with a single view initialized using
	  setUpViewAcrossAllScreens(). I have attached a modified
	  osgpick.cpp so
	  you can test it out quickly (please don't check this file in
	  though :-)
	  ) The eventState is then incorrect and picking does not work. The
	  only
	  changes are in CompositeViewer.cpp (eventTraversal() method), and
	  fix
	  the problem for me.
	  "

2008-03-04 16:39  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Attached is an updated to
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32.
	  
	  The win32 pbuffer implementation returned an error unless both
	  the
	  WGL_ARB_pbuffer and the WGL_ARB_render_texture functions were
	  present.
	  This was too restrictive, as a pbuffer can usefully be created
	  without
	  render-to-texture, e.g. for use with glReadPixels. The osg
	  1.2/Producer
	  pbuffers worked without RTT, and osgUtil::RenderStage has all the
	  code to
	  handle both RTT and non-RTT pbuffers, doing a read and copy in
	  the
	  latter case.
	  
	  With these changes I have successfully tested the osgprerender
	  example
	  on a graphics card which supports RTT, and one which doesn't.
	  Plus
	  tested in my own application.
	  
	  In order to aid diagnostics I have also added more function
	  status
	  return checks, and associated error messages. I have included the
	  win32
	  error text in all error messages output. And there were some
	  errors
	  with multi-threaded handling of "bind to texture" and a temporary
	  window
	  context which I have corrected.
	  
	  These is one (pre-existing) problem with multi-threaded use of
	  pbuffers
	  in osgViewer & osgprerender, which I have not been able to fix. A
	  win32
	  device context (HDC) can only be destroyed from the thread that
	  created
	  it. The pbuffers for pre-render cameras are created in
	  osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp, from the draw thread. But
	  closeImplementation is normally invoked from the destructor in
	  the main
	  application thread. With the additional error messages I have
	  added,
	  osgprerender will now output a couple of warnings from
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32::closeImplementation() at exit, after
	  running multi-threaded on windows. I think that is a good thing,
	  to
	  highlight the problem. I looked into fixing it in
	  osgViewer::Renderer &
	  osgUtil::RenderStage, but it was too involved for me. My own
	  application requirements are only single-threaded.
	  
	  Unrelated fix - an uninitialised variable in
	  osg::GraphicsThread::FlushDeletedGLObjectsOperation().
	  "

2008-03-04 16:22  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Attached is modified
	  osgShadow::ShadowMap. I changed following things:
	  
	  1:
	  Shadow map camera sets ABSOLUTE_RF_INHERIT_VIEWPOINT refernce
	  frame.
	  
	  2:
	  Light Direction by matrix multiplications replaced with
	  transform3x3 multiplication.
	  
	  3:
	  I made DebugingHUD functional by adding special draw callback.
	  Former version was simply drawing pale square.
	  
	  4:
	  I was tempted to make 4 th change but decided to not do it.
	  Instead I put it whith #if VIEW_DEPNDENT_TEXGEN. If you decide
	  you may let it go.
	  
	  When objects are not centered at 0,0,0 coord but in some distant
	  location (for example at surface of earth ellipsoid) shadow
	  texgen suffers from inadequate precision of float matrices. I
	  changed that by premultiplying Texgen matrix (using OSG double
	  matrices) with inverse modelview and applying it later with
	  ModelView identity matrix. This tweak may be appropriate for
	  OverlayNode texgen as well.
	  
	  I left former version because I suspect that this change will
	  make osgShadow::ShadowMap view dependant. Currently texgen matrix
	  remains the same no matter what View displays it. With my change
	  it wuld be different for each view. This touches the subject of
	  View Dependent Shadow Techniques that J-S asked recently."

2008-03-04 16:03  robert

	* Refactored the way that the camera settings are inhertied

2008-03-04 15:29  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "in the current implementation of the
	  FrameBufferObject
	  there is a bug. The header file do specify something
	  like this:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D* target, int zoffset,
	  int level = 0);
	  
	  However in the .cpp file we have:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment::FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D*
	  target, int level, int zoffset)
	  
	  
	  Which means that the meaning of level and zoffset is
	  interchanged.
	  
	  The file with the corrected line is attached. Should
	  go into src/osg/
	  "

2008-03-04 15:10  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "A missing _WIN32_WINNT declaration causes
	  MinGW compilation to fail when reaching FileNameUtils.cpp and the
	  Windows 2000 function GetLongPathName() is called."

2008-03-04 14:19  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay and Robert Osfield, added optional

2008-02-27 11:46  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Per the discussion in osg-users, this change

2008-02-27 11:43  robert

	* Added debug message to track cache usage

2008-02-25 17:30  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed handling of modified keys when
	  entering/leaving window

2008-02-25 16:50  robert

	* From Franz Melchior, "When switching virtual desktops or
	  minimizing a window, keys
	  remain in pressed state after revealing, even if they are no
	  longer pressed on the keyboard. This can have bad effects,
	  especially if the stuck keys are modifier keys. One has to
	  press and release the stuck keys again to reset the wrong state.
	  
	  The fix keeps track of all key presses and releases. On FocusOut
	  and UnmapNotify it releases all keys that are in pressed state,
	  and on KeymapNotify (following a FocusIn), it sets the currently
	  pressed keys again. To avoid confusion in the OSG-using
	  application
	  normal keys are always reported released /before/ and pressed
	  /after/ modifier keys.
	  
	  As current key states are returned as char[32] keymap by
	  XQueryKeymap and XKeymapEvent, this format is also used to
	  recognize modifier keys and for maintaining the current
	  internal key state. Functions to set/clear/query bits in
	  such a keymap are added.
	  
	  The patch was extensively tested with osgkeyboard and
	  FlightGear under KDE and fvwm2. It was not tested on a
	  Xinerama setup or with multiple windows, but as _eventDisplay
	  is used throughout, there should be no problems. The patch also
	  makes the following changes:
	  
	  - removes old and obsolete handling of modifier keys in
	  ::adaptKey().
	  This wasn't only unused, but also wrong (and for that reason
	  commented
	  out in revision 7066). The modifier states are actually handled
	  in ./src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp (EventQueue::keyPress/keyRelease).
	  - fixes some spelling"

2008-02-25 16:26  robert

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I'm joining two zip files to this mail for
	  the modified sources and include files of osgIntrospection.
	  
	  The modifications I made are very small but they are absolutely
	  usefull to use osgIntrospection with visual studio 7.1 or 8 in
	  debug modes.
	  This should also solve other minor common problems (converter
	  memory leak, virtual destructor for PropertyInfo, etc...).
	  
	  I choosed two function names : Reflection::uninitialize() and
	  Type::reset(), this can of course be changed if someone has a
	  better idea...
	  
	  I made the changes against OSG 2.2.0 public release. I tested the
	  result with VS 7.1, VS 7.1 SP1, VS 8.0 SP1 and AQTime 5.0 on
	  Windows XP SP2... All 4 seem to agree : they detected memory
	  leaks before and don't anymore.
	  
	  Sorry I haven't take the time to test that on linux but the
	  changes are so small I doubt there could be a problem... I let
	  you check that on your side :-).
	  
	  I hope this will help making OSG an even more wonderfull
	  library."

2008-02-25 16:05  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "I missed a refactoring of the handling of
	  modifier-keys, so they did not
	  work on OS X. Attached you'll find the missing implementation for
	  OS X."

2008-02-25 15:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change adds "GL_NORMALIZE" and
	  "GL_RESCALE_NORMAL" to .osg IO in place of the hex equivalents."

2008-02-25 15:08  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-02-25 15:07  robert

	* From Robert Osfield and Carlo Camporesi, took submission from
	  Carlo for adding LoadingExternalReferenceMode to ProxyNode and
	  extended it
	  to include a wider range of options, also completed
	  implementation

2008-02-25 14:27  robert

	* Changed method parameter to use const &

2008-02-25 14:15  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "----1----
	  
	  Attached is a fixed version of OverlayNode.cpp. I fixed
	  CustomPolytope::cut( osg::Plane ) method. Bug was apparent in
	  such scenario:
	  
	  Let P1 be some random frustum polytope
	  Let P2 be the polytope that was created from P1 bounding box (P2
	  contains P1 entirely)
	  
	  Then ignoring precision errors: P1.cut( P2 ) == P2.cut( P1 ) ==
	  P1. But this condition was not always met. Cut failed when some
	  of the polytope reference points happened to lie exactly on some
	  intersecting planes in both P1 & P2 (plane distance was = 0).
	  
	  I only use CustomPolytope for my shadowing stuff so I did not
	  test how this affects rest of OverlayNode.cpp.
	  
	  ----2----
	  
	  Also attached is a minor precision improvement for osg::Plane
	  intersect method (double version).
	  
	  ----3----
	  
	  I have also one observation regarding osg::Plane - There are two
	  intersect vertices methods (float and double flavour):
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3>& vertices) const
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3d>& vertices) const
	  
	  I guess osg::Plane won't compile when someone changes default
	  vec3 typedef to vec3d. Shouldn't the first method be changed to
	  use vec3f explicitly ? Ie:
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3f>& vertices) const"

2008-02-25 13:25  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "As you may recall, we discussed adding
	  ReaderWriter::readObject() overrides to all the image plugins in
	  order to facilitate future archive support. Attached are the
	  necessary modifications. I tested JPEG, but not all the others...
	  the code is identical though. Note that the DDS plugin already
	  contained the readObject() implementations."

2008-02-25 13:17  robert

	* From Wojciech Lawandowski, "Fixed
	  EllipsoidModel::computeLocalUpVector to use Vec3d instead of Vec3
	  for
	  normal computation. Its really small issue, maybe not even worth
	  submitting
	  ;-). But one never knows when inadequate precision hits him.
	  "

2008-02-25 13:16  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-02-25 13:07  robert

	* Reverted back to previous version of osgtext

2008-02-25 12:54  robert

	* Refactored the mutex usage in osgText and freetype plugin to
	  prevent multi-thread crash

2008-02-22 18:38  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have extended the X11 pbuffer code to
	  use either the complete set of glx 1.3
	  pbuffer functions or exactly ask for the extensions we need to
	  call the
	  apropriate glx extension functions for and around pbuffers
	  extensions.
	  The glx 1.3 version of this functios are prefered. If this is not
	  pressent we
	  are looking for the glx extensions and check for them.
	  Prevously we just used some mix of the glx 1.3 functions or the
	  extension
	  functions without making sure that this extension is present.
	  "

2008-02-22 11:52  robert

	* Refactored osgTerrain so that the interface for setting up layer

	  osgTerrain::Layer

2008-02-19 16:02  robert

2008-02-19 12:26  robert

	* Changed the updating of the contextID so that the
	  DisplaySetting::MaxNumberOfGrapicsContexts()
	  is updated on each new graphics context creation, in keeping with
	  how osgProducer used to do things.

2008-02-19 11:30  robert

	* Refactor the rendering code to not use iterators, instead using
	  indices as means of avoiding using < and += on STL iterators that
	  have shown to be problematic under Windows

2008-02-19 09:49  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, workaround for gcc 3.2.3 bug

2008-02-18 15:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "Attached you'll find some enhancements by
	  Adrian Egli and me for the
	  carbon-implementation of GraphicsWindow. Now you can use an
	  AGLDrawable
	  in conjunction with osgViewer/osgCompositeViewer."
	  
	  Changes from Robert Osfield, changed std::cout to
	  osg::notify(osg::INFO)

2008-02-18 15:26  robert

	* From Rene Molenaar, "Using commandline build system nmake on
	  windows does not work.
	  
	  This is caused by the OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL hack.
	  there are hard-coded paths to place the dll's in the bin /dir
	  that normally would go
	  in the lib/config (release/debug) dirs. Nmake has different
	  locations for the files (no config dir).
	  
	  fix: change the macro's in OsgMacroUtils.cmake for the IF(NOT
	  MSVC_IDE) situation.
	  Libs go in lib/, and DLLs and executables go in bin/
	  To accopmplish this for MSVC_IDE the targets get a "../../bin"
	  prefix,
	  for nmake this should be "../bin" (because there are no config
	  folders).
	  
	  This fix mimics the behaviour of the MSCV_IDE (visual studio)
	  build system when building with nmake.
	  
	  Note:
	  A change in the main CMakeLists.txt creates the needed plugin
	  directory in the binary dir.
	  
	  see included files for the changes:
	  r7885fix-v2/CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake
	  r7885fix-v2/osgWrappers/CMakeLists.txt
	  r7885fix-v2/CMakeLists.txt
	  
	  
	  The behaviour of visual studio projects (and other build systems)
	  remain unchanged.
	  Tested building and installing with nmake and visual studio 8
	  debug and release.
	  "

2008-02-18 15:17  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "Subject: obj material parse fix
	  this fix strips whitespace off externally referenced material
	  files.
	  fixes a bug where the obj listed something like:
	  
	  mtllib FR_PARIS_ESPACE_UNESCO_S.MTL
	  
	  and then that caused failures in the load later:
	  
	  FindFileInPath() : trying /Users/rpk/Downloads/
	  FR_PARIS_ESPACE_UNESCO_S.MTL ...
	  
	  this fix simply strips whitespace around that filename before
	  passing
	  it on to the remainder of the loader."
	  
	  Changes from Robert Osfield, change std::cout to
	  osg::notify(osg::INFO)

2008-02-18 15:10  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "On Dec 16 you introduced a fix to remove
	  internal use of ref_ptr<>'s.
	  It contained a bug that would cause freed memory to be written
	  again.
	  Specifically, in FreeTypeLibrary::~FreeTypeLibrary(), calling
	  font->setImplementation(0); deletes the content pointed to by the
	  fontImplementation pointer, while the line the immediately
	  follows
	  tries to access it.
	  
	  My fix is to make the second instruction part of an else clause
	  rather
	  than always executed. This way, the fontImplementation->_facade =
	  0
	  instruction is only executed when the font implementation is not
	  set
	  to 0 before (although I have no idea what it is here for and if
	  this
	  code path is ever followed, since I don't know the plugin's
	  internals
	  very well).
	  
	  Attached is the modified FreeTypeLibrary.cpp file."

	* From Bob Kuehne, build fix for OSX/gcc 4.0.1

2008-02-18 13:52  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "Here's a fix to the changes regarding the
	  new dispose() function. The
	  last primary node inside a push-pop level would not get the
	  dispose()
	  call. This would result in information from some ancillary
	  records,
	  like the matrix (transform), being lost.
	  
	  Changes are made to the latest version in the repository.
	  
	  Thanks to Terry for the help to find and fix the bug and test the
	  changes."

2008-02-18 13:47  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "moved the prints to a higher notify level
	  (DEBUG_FP) so they are only printed at the most verbose level."

2008-02-18 13:44  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Attached is a modification to
	  OcclusionQueryNode. The copy constructor was failing to

	* From Glen Waldon, "This change patches ReaderWriterOSGA.cpp so
	  that it passes along the ReaderWriter::Options to files loaded
	  from inside the archive. Previously it was discarding them.
	  
	  example:
	  osgviewer -O noLoadExternalReferenceFiles archive.osga"

	  randomize color by feature: osgviewerd -e ogr -O
	  UseRandomColorByFeature
	  yourFile"

2008-01-28 15:41  robert

	* Added projectorMatrix parameter support to *SphericalDisplay
	  setup functions and .view, this allows one

2008-01-21 14:42  robert

	* From Drederic Bouvier, "I noticed the AC3D loader resets database
	  path given as Options,
	  preventing users to put textures in another directory. This patch
	  adds
	  the model path to the path list instead of replacing it."

2008-01-21 14:41  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Multi-texturing fails with recent osg on
	  older graphics cards, due to
	  use of parameter GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS which is
	  only part
	  of the standard from 2.0 onwards. I've updated src/osg/State.cpp,

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached are a few Find modules with updates.
	  Among other things, they
	  contain better support for environmental variables to pre-empt
	  the
	  autodection default search path order which is very helpful for
	  people
	  who do automated builds. (I recommend that the remaining modules
	  consider adding the same system to make things consistent and
	  easier
	  for those people that want to do the automated builds.)
	  
	  The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH has also been added to help people. I don't
	  recommend adding this to the other modules because it looks like
	  CMake
	  agreed with my idea and will be adding the support in 2.6. So
	  when
	  that ships, people will get it for free. (In the meantime, my
	  modules
	  that do have it, it can be used.)
	  
	  Finally, I've submitted all of these modules to official CMake
	  plus
	  more so they will be in the next version of CMake. It looks like
	  I may
	  need to sort some compatibility issues out with the KDE people
	  who
	  seem to have conflicting modules, but this is unrelated to the
	  updates
	  submitted here as OSG already has these conflicts. I figured I
	  would
	  just sync OSG up with my current/best versions.
	  
	  Also of note, I added the large batch of Findosg*.cmake modules
	  to
	  CMake so people building against OpenSceneGraph can use these
	  without
	  writing their own. I wasn't sure if I should submit them here or
	  not
	  since they are for building against OSG and not for building OSG
	  itself. So they are not included.

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When using osg::Sequence you can stop
	  the sequence by setting the mode
	  to STOP. Subsequently, you can restart it from the beginning by
	  setting the mode to START. This does not work as expected. The
	  _now
	  time is not updated while the mode is STOP, which causes the
	  items in
	  the sequence to flash by very quickly when the mode is set to
	  START.
	  
	  For example, if the mode was set to STOP and left that way for 30
	  seconds, and there are 10 items in the sequence, when the mode is
	  set
	  to START all the items will flash by (in 3 loops) while the _now
	  time
	  catches up with the real time, and then the sequence will go on
	  at the
	  rate it should.
	  
	  This is a simple fix for that, which updates the _now time
	  regardless
	  of the mode the sequence is in."

	  setToBoundingBox It was
	  sent at beginning of december. I read it when purging my Thrash
	  emails and
	  found it there this because it was wrongly classified as SPAM.
	  
	  What stroke me in this email was the fact that there was once an

	  my minimal shadow area computations I checked my code for this
	  error. And I

	  CustomPolytope::setToBoundingBox seemed OK.
	  
	  So I went back to the origin and fixed this error in

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, "I earlier wrote about my hassles with
	  archives under Windows. I implemented
	  64 bit binary compatible OSGA archive reader/writer using mixed
	  stdio/iostream calls. But during this work I learned that it can
	  be made in
	  much simpler way.
	  
	  Attached is result of this new attempt. I hope its appropriate
	  for inclusion
	  into OSG codebase. It was compiled and tested with latest SVN
	  OSG, Windows
	  XP 32 bit and Windows Vista business 64 bit. OSG was built using
	  VS 2005
	  Express SP1 for 32 bit environment and VS 2005 Std for 64 bit.
	  ---
	  Solution description (there were two problems involved):
	  ---
	  Problem 1: implicit conversions beetween file positions and 32
	  bit int. This
	  could be considered a MS compiler bug because this 32 bit int was
	  additionally implicitly converted to/from 64 bit. As far as I
	  know compiler
	  is allowed to make only one implict conversion (but maybe this
	  rule does not
	  refer to simple types).
	  
	  Its actually possible to address OSGA files above 4 GiB range
	  using 32 bit
	  windows iostreams. MS Iostreams in practice offer the same level
	  of
	  functionality as stdio functions. There are functions fsetpos and
	  fgetpos in
	  stdio lib which use 64 bit file pointers (fpos_t). These
	  functions are
	  internally called by seekp( streampos ), seekg( streampos ),
	  tellp(), and
	  tellg() methods. So its also possible to change and retrieve file
	  postions
	  using iostream calls. But the problem lies in implicit handling
	  of streampos
	  type.
	  
	  streampos type is actually a template class used as seekp, seekg
	  parameter
	  and returnd from tellp, tellg. Its capable of storing 64 bit file
	  pointers.
	  But streampos can be also converted to/from simple type
	  streamoff. It has
	  proper constructor and cast operator. In Win 32 environment
	  streamoff is
	  defined as long (~32 bit int). So when seekp, and tellp arent
	  used with
	  exact streampos objects but OSGA_Archive::pos_type complier makes
	  implicit
	  casts to 32 bit int types loosing important bits of information.
	  
	  So above problem could be easily handled by making conversion
	  calls
	  explicit. My code defines 2 functions used to convert back and
	  forth beetwen
	  64 bit OSGA_Archive::pos_type and std::streampos objects:
	  
	  OSGA_Archive::pos_type ARCHIVE_POS( const std::streampos & pos );
	  std::streampos STREAM_POS( OSGA_Archive::pos_type & pos );
	  
	  Rest of the OSGA implementation code was modified to call these
	  conversions
	  explicitly with seekp, seekg, tellp, tellg.
	  
	  ---
	  Problem 2: seekp and seekg have two variants. Only one of these
	  variants is
	  actually 64 bit proof.
	  
	  When I solved my first problem and made use of explicit streampos
	  conversion
	  functions, OSGA archive was able to read my example 11 GiB
	  archive. But
	  there were still problems with write and append. I found that the
	  reason for
	  this was pair of seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) and tellp()
	  calls. It turned
	  out that use of seekp, seekg( offset, direction ) function
	  variants was
	  setting file pos pointer to EOF when file was larger than 4GiB.
	  But I
	  noticed that one arg seekp, seekg ( streampos ) versions worked
	  correctly.
	  So the solution was to change OSGA write logic a little, and
	  replace
	  seekp( offset, direction ) with seekp( absolute_pos ) calls.
	  I achieved this by modifing IndexBlock write method to record and
	  restore
	  file pos after IndexBlock was written. This modification has the
	  effect that
	  put pointer is generally kept at the end of file, so there is no
	  need to
	  repostion to the end before writing the files. This allowed me to
	  get rid of
	  those problematic seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) calls.
	  
	  There was one place where I could not easily get rid of seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ). It was situation where existing OSGA was
	  opened for
	  appending. I resolved this by computing file length by finding
	  max position
	  from index block and file block endings. Then I replaced former
	  seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ) with seekp( STREAM_POS( found_file_length ).
	  ---
	  
	  Description of these changes may sound bit hacky but in practice
	  these were
	  fairly simple and straightforward modifications. I hope they pass
	  your
	  review. There is one complex preprocessor condition which I based
	  on few
	  lines taken from boost positioning.hpp. Boost licence does allow
	  such
	  reproduction. In case of problems this condition may be easily
	  simplified to
	  windows only implementation.

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some clients at my new job noticed
	  that picking did not work with the
	  osg::Capsule subclass of osg::Shape in an osg::ShapeDrawable.
	  Other
	  shapes worked fine. So I have fixed this. Code attached.
	  
	  My modification is in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor, and is based on
	  the
	  DrawShapeVisitor - I added methods called createCylinderBody and
	  createHalfSphere, and used them in apply(Cylinder&) and
	  apply(Capsule&). In my testing they work fine, tested even with
	  transforms and moving around the scene.

	  But writing BlinkSequence with empty sequence group caused a
	  crash when IVE was accessing baseTime from NULL address.
	  
	  Atttached is a fix for this situation.

	  initialsation code that checks for the GLX
	  version before issuing commands that require GLX-1.3.
	  
	  This prevents a crash with open source drivers on linux.
	  "

2007-12-11 14:06  robert

	* From Roger James, "The changes are as follows:-
	  
	  1. DAE object no longer held onto by plugin.
	  2. Filename to URI conversion now handled internally by plugin.
	  2. User can supply an external DAE object for use by the plugin.
	  3. User can supply a std:string object for the plugin to return
	  the URI of
	  the document just processed.
	  4. User can supply a std::string to receive the unit name
	  information from
	  the document just read in. (e.g. meters, inches, etc.)
	  5. User can supply a float to receive the metric conversion
	  factor from the
	  document just read in.
	  6. User can supply an enum to receive the up axis orientation
	  information
	  from the document just read in.
	  7. Material transparency can be both read and written.
	  8. User can supply an experimental GoogleMode option on output.
	  The plugin
	  will try to emulate the way Sketchup specifies transparency (i.e.
	  the
	  inverse of what it should be!). I am still struggling to get GE
	  to
	  understand transparency, anyone know what it expects?
	  9. Rudimentary support for Collada effect parameters (newparam,
	  setparam,
	  param) on input. Basic nVidia FX Composer dae documents can now
	  be read.
	  
	  "

2007-12-11 12:35  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-11 12:32  robert

	* From Tim More, "This submission tries to optimize redundant
	  compilation of StateSets and Drawables
	  in the DatabasePager. The practical effects of these are to
	  greatly reduce startup time
	  and the time to load an individual scenery tile in FlightGear.
	  
	  - From my log message:
	  
	  Minimize the number of StateSets and drawables that are compiled
	  by checking
	  if they have already been compiled or will be elminated by the
	  SharedStateManager.
	  
	  Move the sorting of the dataToCompile queue out of
	  compileGLObjects
	  into the man pager run function.
	  
	  Change the SharedStateManager to use maps instead of vectors."
	  

2007-12-11 11:57  robert

	* From Joseph Steel, "he change is to initializeExtensionProcs() to
	  verify the version of the OpenGL implementation before attempting
	  to get the
	  MaxTextureCoords parameter."

2007-12-11 11:55  robert

	* From Mathias Froelich, "I have cleaned up the state set handling
	  of the osg::ClipNode.
	  Previously the complete StateSet was cleared, even the non
	  clipping releted
	  state attributes and modes in this stateset on a call to
	  setLocalSetateSetModes.
	  With this change only those modes/attributes are changed that
	  need to be
	  changed. That is, if a clip plane is removed from the ClipNode,
	  only this
	  assiciated mode is removed from the state set, instead of
	  throwing away the
	  whole state set.
	  
	  In this way we have less surprising results if the state set of a
	  clip node is
	  used for more state than just the clip state.
	  "

2007-12-11 11:42  robert

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "I have extended the StateSet api with a
	  
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedModes(const StateAttribute*)
	  
	  and a
	  
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedTextureModes(unsigned, const
	  StateAttribute*)
	  
	  call. These funktions are just missing for a complete api IMO."

2007-12-11 11:37  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "it seems that include/osgParticle/BoxPlacer
	  was created from the SectorPlacer
	  file. The code works well but the SectorPlacer comments stayed in
	  the new
	  file. I have altered those comments so they now contain valid
	  information for
	  the BoxPlacer class and the doxygen generated documentation is
	  correct.
	  
	  "

2007-12-11 11:21  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix allowing removal of shaders
	  from a program after it is
	  first compiled. It will also allow new shaders to be attached
	  after the
	  program is first compiled."

2007-12-10 20:56  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "In ESRIShapeParser.cpp, wasn't closing the
	  file handle. Added:
	  
	  if(fd)
	  {
	  close(fd);
	  fd = 0;
	  }
	  
	  
	  to the constructor."

2007-12-10 20:36  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "For osgviewerCocoa, a very simple change to
	  allow toggling between
	  fullscreen mode and back between views. (To activate, double
	  click on
	  the view to toggle.) It demonstrates/uses the new one-liner
	  fullscreen
	  method introduced in Leopard. Code will still compile and run in
	  pre-Leopard (thanks to Obj-C dynamic/late binding), but code path
	  is
	  treated as a no-op in those cases."

2007-12-10 20:35  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-10 20:33  robert

	* From Richard Schmidt, fix on ordering to be standard OpenGL way.

2007-12-10 20:30  robert

	* From Richard Schmidt, "attached you will find a set of small
	  fixes and features.
	  
	  
	  
	  CullVisitor/SceneView:
	  
	  *Feature: This version supports multiple clearnodes in the graph,
	  one per renderstage.
	  
	  
	  
	  Text:
	  
	  *Feature: Performance Enhancement when calling SetBackdropColor
	  
	  
	  
	  Material:
	  
	  *Fix: OpenGL calls are now made according to the OpenGL Standard
	  
	  "

2007-12-10 20:27  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "attached are some fixes and tweaks I made
	  to the .obj loader:
	  - Material class contained both 'shininess' and 'Ns' member
	  variables
	  - 'Ns' and 'Ni' are initialized to 0 ('Ni' is unused at the
	  moment)
	  - only 'Ns' was read from .mtl file but 'shininess' was used for
	  osg::Material
	  - 'illum' was read from .mtl file but never used; it is now used
	  as follows
	  -- illum==0 -> no osg::Material created/attached therefore no
	  lighting
	  -- illum==1 -> osg::Material specular is set to black
	  -- illum==2 (default) -> specular read from .mtl file is used
	  - 'map_Kd' and 'map_Ks' may contain additional arguments (e.g.
	  '-s 1 1 1'),
	  these are now skipped over and the texture filename is properly
	  extracted
	  "

2007-12-09 16:38  robert

	* From Gustavo Wagner, fixed bugs in reading M records from
	  shapefile

2007-12-09 16:29  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added the following features to
	  the OSG VRML plugin:
	  * Support for Box, Sphere, Cone, and Cylinder. These nodes are
	  converted
	  to osg::Geometry conform the VRML97 spec.
	  * Backface culling is enabled/disabled according to the "solid"
	  flag for
	  geometries that are converted from IndexFaceSets.
	  * PROTO instances can now be used for "appearance" and "geometry"
	  fields
	  in a Shape node.
	  
	  The file ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp is adapted for the latest stable
	  public
	  release:
	  
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenSceneGraph/tags/OpenSceneGraph-2.2.0
	  
	  The changes where needed for being able to read VRML file which
	  are
	  output by VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). A sample
	  VRML file
	  is enclosed in this submission.
	  
	  The plugin has been tested against a number of VRML samples that
	  include
	  texturing. The texturing is found to be VRML97 compliant for all
	  added
	  geometry nodes.

2007-12-09 16:23  robert

	* Removed redundent OpenFlightOptimizer

2007-12-09 16:14  robert

	* From Ralf Karn, fixed "invalid enumerant" warning on
	  TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_EXT initialization

2007-12-09 16:06  robert

	* From Mihai Radu, "After someone asked for a fix for non-textured
	  object appearing black
	  with the shader for textured objects. This works very well in
	  cases
	  where there could be a mix of textured and non-textured objects
	  in the
	  scene, and it makes the initialization more robust.
	  The idea is from PSSM, to add a 1pixel texture to the main
	  rendering as
	  to provide white for any objects missing textures."

2007-12-09 16:01  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-09 15:43  robert

2007-12-09 12:19  robert

	* From Aderian Egli, changed the window dimension clamping code to
	  work independantly for width and height.

2007-12-08 17:10  robert

	* From Mario Guimaraes, "Currently, in the StateSet::merge method,
	  the rhs state attributes and
	  modes are not merged into the lhs state when the rhs is
	  PROTECTED. The
	  changes I'm providing here address this problem."

2007-12-08 17:04  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Hi Robert,
	  
	  You were right about the CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS option for
	  CMake, so here is a modification allowing to not generate the
	  manifest files for the plugins making them a lot more easy to
	  redistribute. I have also made the same modification to the
	  wrappers as they are also put into the osgPlugin folder when
	  generated.
	  "

2007-12-08 17:00  robert

	* from Paul Matz, "Understood. Well, I think it's reasonable to
	  assume that the non-env var
	  case is the more tested case, and therefore it is correct to set
	  _supportsVertexBufferObjects to the same value as _fastPath. So
	  here's a
	  change that does the same thing for the env var case."

2007-12-08 16:52  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, Anders Backman and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  both Jeremy and Anders added static build support as an option,
	  but one was
	  for Unix and one for Windowsm, but the two mods were also
	  inconsitent in naming
	  and implementation. I have had a bash at merging them both, but
	  don't know yet
	  if these changes will work yet on either configuration... user
	  testing will tell...

2007-12-08 16:37  robert

	* From Peter Hrenka, "Due to popular demand I would like to submit
	  this
	  enhanced version of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  
	  New features of PolytopeIntersector :
	  
	  * Dimension mask: The user may specify the dimensions of the
	  primitives to be tested. Checking polytope-triangle and
	  polytope-quad intersections is rather slow so this can
	  be turned off.
	  * Reference plane: The resulting intersections are sorted
	  by the distance to this plane.
	  
	  New memebers of PolytopeIntersector::Intersection :
	  
	  * distance: Distance of localIntersectionPoint to the reference
	  plane
	  * maxDistance: Maximum distance of all intersectionPoints to the
	  reference plane.
	  * intersectionPoints: The points intersecting the planes of the
	  polytope
	  or points completely inside the polytope.
	  * localIntersectionPoint: arithmetic mean of all intersection
	  points
	  * primitiveIndex: Index of the primitive that intersected
	  
	  
	  I added some more output to the example osgkeyboardmouse."

2007-12-08 15:46  robert

	* From David Cullu and Robert Osfield, David addded a new style of
	  OSG integration with QT by sublcassing from QTWidget and using
	  osgViewer to create the graphics context, Robert added
	  integration of this codes
	  with the original AdapterWidget implementation still available by
	  default. The new implementation can be accessed by running:
	  
	  osgviewerQT cow.osg --QOSGWidget
	  

2007-12-08 15:32  robert

	* From Daniel Larimer, "There was a error with QTUtils.h when
	  compiling on HFS case-sensitive
	  file system. The #include<Quicktime/Quicktime.h> line needs to be
	  replaced with #include<QuickTime/QuickTime.h"

2007-12-08 15:27  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "Please find attached a replacement for the 3DS
	  pluggin's ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file. This contains a minor fix
	  (one line added) to ensure that the OSG Material structure is
	  given the name of the material definition within a loaded 3DS
	  file.
	  "

2007-12-08 15:08  robert

	* From Donald Cipperly, Fixed memory leak in computeIntersections

2007-12-08 15:04  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, "This extra call to SDL_VideoSetMode()
	  prevents my viewport from getting
	  all wonky when I resize the SDL window. I'm not sure if this bug
	  has
	  always existed or not, but according to the SDL documentation
	  this
	  operation should be safe regardless, and doesn't not introduce
	  the need
	  for extra memory management (that is: there is no need to
	  "cleanup" the
	  old screen variable, that is all handled by SDL for us).
	  "

2007-12-08 13:29  robert

	* From Robert Osfield and Richard Schmidt, made fixes inspired by
	  an original submission from Richard which
	  highlighted problems with Light, ClipPlane and Hint usage in
	  osg::State's usage of cloneType
	  and reassignment of target/num in StateSet/these StateAttributes.

2007-12-08 12:12  robert

	* From David Callu, added IO_FluidProgram implementation.

2007-12-07 13:42  robert

	* Added an #include<assert.h> to avoid compile problems on some
	  systems.

2007-12-07 13:28  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin, "Attached is a small fix for the openflight
	  loader with regard to road
	  segment and construction records.
	  
	  It just uses the id field to set the name of the osg node as with
	  other
	  types."

2007-12-07 13:19  robert

	* From Paul Martz, minor typo fixes in notify messages

2007-12-06 17:53  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, added extra event handlers

2007-12-06 17:44  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The bmp writer crashes in certain cases.
	  It happens when the computed
	  size of the image data is greater than the actual image size.
	  This
	  causes the memcpy call to go out of the array bounds. I modified
	  the
	  code so that it copies the data during the iteration, instead of
	  memcpy'ing. This fixes the problems i was having.
	  
	  If you are curious, the writer was crashing when trying to write
	  an
	  RGB image that was 2050 x 1280. You might be able to reproduce it
	  by
	  allocating an empty image of that size and writing it to a file."

2007-12-06 17:41  robert

	* From Hautio Jari, "Current version of GraphicsWindowWin32 allows
	  resize to zero height
	  window. This breaks rendering in for example MFC SDI applications
	  and in
	  MFC MDI applications if user resizes the window so that client
	  area has
	  zero height. Current safeguard for minimized window:
	  
	  LRESULT GraphicsWindowWin32::handleNativeWindowingEvent( HWND
	  hwnd, UINT
	  uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam )
	  ...
	  /////////////////
	  case WM_MOVE :
	  case WM_SIZE :
	  /////////////////
	  ...
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 && clientRect.right==0)
	  ...
	  
	  does not cover this situation. In these situations
	  clientRect.bottom = 0
	  and clientRect.right > 0.
	  
	  Quick fix to this is relax condition:
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 || clientRect.right==0)
	  
	  Modified file is attached.
	  
	  Tested with osgviewerMFC from 2.2.0 release (Windows XP sp2)
	  
	  Before fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - just blue screen, no cow
	  
	  After fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - the cow is where it is supposed to be.

2007-12-06 17:31  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here are some modifications to the
	  DatabasePager, with the possibility to :
	  
	  - Get or set the target number of PagedLOD children to remove per
	  frame.
	  - Get or set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD to keep.
	  
	  Corresponding environment variables have been added too.
	  The default values reproduce the previous DatabasePager
	  behavior."

2007-12-06 17:28  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, fixes for toggle fullscreen on gnome desktop

2007-12-06 17:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "n examples/osgfadetext/CMakeLists.txt

2007-12-06 17:01  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a changed version of
	  osgunittests.cpp. The __FUNCTION__
	  macro/string value is not portable. Instead the functions name is
	  just put
	  into the string."

2007-12-06 16:50  robert

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, fixed the hardwiring of archive
	  extensions to 4 charaters

2007-12-06 10:04  robert

	* Fixed crash in cfg by rearranging the code blocks so the codes
	  that use the graphics context are only called when a graphics
	  context is successfully aquired.

2007-12-06 09:22  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, added osgViewer dependency for OSX build

2007-12-05 18:32  robert

2007-12-04 14:46  robert

	* Added support for new double Vec*Array classes in various
	  functors.

2007-12-04 14:46  robert

	* Added optional double support via new Vec3dArray support in
	  osg::Geometry.
	  
	  To enable double usage set the option string "double" i.e.
	  
	  osgviewer myshapefile.shf -O "double"

	* Added missing files for qt plugin

2007-11-09 20:04  ewing

	* For osgdb_freetype:
	  Ugh. Another fix for the cycle problem. It seems that the SDKROOT
	  didn't necessarily solve the problem, but there were some
	  unneeded library dependencies that weren't in my test fork which
	  allowed my test to work, but caused SVN to fail.
	  I have removed some of the excess libraries and it seems to build
	  without the Q&A fix.

2007-11-09 13:16  ewing

	* OpenThreads Version header was mistakenly in Resources.
	  
	  osg Texture2DArray header was mistakenly in Resources.

2007-10-03 23:03  robert

	* From Panagiotis Papadakos, "Setting the maximum height of osgText
	  doen't seem to work. If the text is
	  big enough, it exceeds the height that I gave as input to
	  setMaximumHeight. So check if cursor is out of -_maximumHeight."

2007-10-03 23:01  robert

	* Added support for defining an option
	  OSG_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT within the
	  CMake build system, enabling this option will build the OSG
	  against the (...) version
	  of the tesselation callback functions.
	  
	  One can also set the default value of this option via the
	  DEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT
	  variable that is set locally to OFF for all platforms except AIX
	  and OSX, but can
	  be overriden by setting it via command line option i.e.
	  
	  cmake . -DDDEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT=ON
	  

2007-10-03 21:12  shuber

	* updated XCode projects

2007-10-03 20:21  robert

	* Added GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT path into include/osg/GLU and
	  enabled this
	  for AIX as reading the old paths this was required. This looks
	  like it is needed
	  under Xcode build as well.

	* From Alberto Luaces, build fix for Cygwin.

2007-10-03 08:34  robert

	* Added return 0 to fix warning

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* From Mihair Radu, "Most of the additions are small utility
	  methods:
	  - set the resolution of the shadow map; it calls dirty() to
	  re-initialize at next update
	  - keep a list of Shader objects to use instead of the default
	  ones, if
	  the list is empty, the default shaders are used
	  - explicitly create the Uniform variables, so that subsequent
	  additions
	  that require more Uniforms can put them in a central place
	  - set a Light or LightSource to use explicitly for shadow
	  casting,
	  allows multiple lights in the scene, with one casting shadows
	  
	  There are two additions that do not ( yet ) function correctly,
	  but in
	  the present usage they do not interfere with the regular usage of
	  the
	  techique:
	  - support for using spotlights, it's using Light.spotCutoff to
	  determine
	  if it's a spot-light and not point-light,
	  there is an error in the setup of either the shadow camera or the
	  texgen, most likely due to the direction of the spotlight, since
	  the
	  position is being used just like in point or directional lights.
	  - creation of a debugHUD
	  the hud is created properly, ( the example included shows it ),
	  but
	  it displays only white, there has been some discussion of
	  displaying the
	  shadow map, but I could not find it, the addition of a simple
	  fragment
	  shader with the appropriate color transform should get this
	  going."

2007-10-02 21:28  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-10-02 21:26  robert

	* Introduced a OSG_PLUGIN_PREFIX variable into CMake build system
	  with it set to
	  "" for all platforms except Cygwin where its set to "cygwin_" and
	  Mingw where
	  it is set to "mingw_". Updated osgDB::Registry to look for these
	  for the plugins.
	  Updated the osgintrospection example to search for these names as
	  well.

2007-10-02 21:24  robert

	* Updated to reflect new CompositeViewer threading models

2007-10-02 21:23  robert

	  theading models
	  previously just supported by osgViewer::Viewer

2007-10-02 20:56  robert

	* Changed the search for Qt version to prevent problems when having
	  both Qt3 and Qt4 installed on one machine.

2007-10-02 20:55  robert

	* Added a #ifdef 0 code block to test setting of the
	  StateSetManipulator's DataVariance to DYNAMIC
	  to solve a threading issue relating to mixing of
	  StateSetManipulator and
	  DrawThreadPerContext.

2007-10-02 20:54  robert

	* Changed the GLU_TESS_CALLBACK in an attempt to avoid compile

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 19:53  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "here's the osgDB::Registry changes to add
	  Options to the read*File() interface. As we discussed, this
	  preserves the old interface for backwards compatibility.
	  
	  osgconv also changed to use the new Registry::writeNode()
	  interface. No other applications or examples were affected."

2007-09-30 19:39  robert

	  Viewer

2007-09-30 18:43  robert

	* Added hdwriter to CMake build

2007-09-30 18:42  robert

	* From David Spilling, "Please find attached an extension of the
	  Radiance HDR (RGBE) image reader to support writing.
	  
	  The options are intended to match the existing read options. By
	  default it will only write RGB32F format; if the "RAW" option is
	  selected, it will output 8 bit RGBA as "raw" RGBE. Note also that
	  the writer inserts a flipVertical(); although the RGBE format,
	  according to spec, should support top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top
	  ordering, no software I've found, including that from the formats
	  originator, actually respects this."

2007-09-30 18:33  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am submitting improved Inventor (iv) writer.
	  
	  List of changes:
	  - added support for Billboards and LOD

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 15:07  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 15:06  robert

	* From Dan Minor, "osgText::Text does not currently have a
	  getAxisAlignment method. The
	  attached code adds this, along with a member variable to keep
	  track of
	  the setting. It is based on the latest subversion version, and
	  was
	  tested by creating a new text object with the same axis alignment
	  as an
	  existing one (e.g.
	  new_text->setAxisAlignment(old_text->getAxisAlignment()); )."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, " I originally didn't add a
	  getAxisAlignment()
	  as all setAxisAlignment does is set the Rotation member variable,
	  and
	  potentially one could apply user defined Rotation setting after
	  the
	  setAxisAlignment() which would bring it out of sync with the
	  setAxisAlignment.
	  
	  Rather than reject your submission on the ground of potentially
	  getting out of sync and therefore misleading users I've added a
	  USED_DEFINED_ROTATION to AxisAlignment enum, and set this in the
	  serRotation and then override this setting of _axisAlignment in
	  the
	  setAxisAlingment method. I've also removed the lazy updating
	  optimization you've added to the top of setAxisAlignment to avoid
	  potential problems as well."

2007-09-30 11:37  robert

	* Moved ViewerBase class out into its own header and source file.
	  
	  Improved the support for stats collection in
	  CompositeViewer/StatsHandler.

2007-09-29 16:46  robert

	* Refactor Viewer/CompositeViewer so the both inherit from the a
	  ViewerBase class

	* From Stephan Huber, add basic support for CompositeViewer in
	  StatsHandler

2007-09-29 11:12  robert

	* From Mattias Linde, "Nice, this almost gets the job done, one way
	  communication into the plugin is possible.
	  I've done some additional small modification regarding constness
	  in ReaderWriter and added
	  mutable on _pluginData so passing data back would be possible
	  too.
	  
	  Have updated the collada plugin (ReaderWriterDAE.cpp) to use the
	  map to handle options and
	  have attached the changes.
	  
	  The stuff in daeReader.h and daeWriter.h are just cosmetic
	  changes to get rid of a warning."

2007-09-28 13:42  robert

	* Fixed SphericalDisplay set up codes to properly manage display
	  host/num

2007-09-28 13:38  robert

	  The screen resolution was queried for the wrong display."

2007-09-28 13:35  robert

	* From Mattias Linde, "I've attached a modified ReaderWriter header
	  which has some additions
	  to osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options to handle PluginData."

2007-09-28 08:53  robert

	* Andre Garneau, three fixes in one submissions:
	  
	  "This is a fix for the issue reported by Anders a week ago (see
	  \u201c[osg-users] BUG?: mouse coordinate changes after window
	  move\u201d discussion thread on Sept. 20). The issue was that the
	  initial implementation added a few months back was not converting
	  the window coordinates to client-area coordinates resulting in a
	  slight offset each time a decorated window was moved (caused by
	  the window border). This was also causing windows to move out of
	  their assigned screen."
	  
	  and
	  
	  "Attached is a fix for the taskbar repaint issue that occurs when
	  a graphics window is toggled from full-screen mode to windowed
	  mode (as identified by Gert van Maren a couple of weeks ago).
	  Also included is a fix derived from the \u201cEvents from the
	  past\u201d discussion thread that took place on July 11."

	* From Adrian Egli, "update the PSSM, i did some bug fixes and
	  added new features to move the camera virtual against the view
	  direction by applaying a simple distance factor (a), which is
	  calculated camera eye - camera center distance. and we can move
	  the "light camera" against the light direction (b).
	  
	  (a) some objects behind the camera can cast shadow
	  (b) object aboive the camera can cast shadow
	  
	  then i fixed the shadow map orientation, now screen x coordinate
	  alinged which improve the quality"

2007-09-27 12:15  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, compile fix for HP-UX without large file
	  support

2007-09-27 10:47  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Some more file that needs some
	  adjustment because of missing member templates

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a first implementation
	  for the obj-plugin to write
	  obj-files. It is not feature complete but usable.
	  
	  Known issues:
	  * not all materials are handled correctly (especially when using
	  osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE), not all properties are supported
	  * could not test point and lines, all of my programs which are
	  capable
	  to read obj-files only import triangle-meshes.
	  * only simple texture-handling"

2007-09-26 10:46  robert

	  some missing
	  file references."

2007-09-24 09:35  robert

	* From Jose Delport: "have been using the new
	  VIEW_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY mode
	  of the OverlayNode.
	  
	  I change the overlay subgraph dynamically and when I remove all
	  the
	  subgraph nodes that is inside the current main camera FOV (others
	  outside still exist), the overlay texture does not update because
	  of the
	  early return in the traversal. I then get a kind of ghost texture
	  moving
	  around the terrain.
	  
	  The attached file fixed the problem for me, but I'm not sure if
	  it is
	  the best way to address the problem."

2007-09-24 09:26  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "Following
	  two lines has to be included into the Image.cpp in the

	* From David Spilling, "Given no replies to my recent "does anybody
	  use the DDS writer" query, I was emboldened to submit this very
	  small patch. The bitmasks for RGBA and RGB have been modified in
	  the writer portion of the code (line 765 onwards). This is now
	  consistent with what the DDS plugin reads. In terms of testing,
	  note that many 3rd party applications erroneously ignore the
	  bitmasks in the file, and assume a BGRA order."

2007-09-11 13:39  robert

	* From Mathias Froenlich, "have a problem with the SunOS CC.
	  It does not like that the prototype of
	  ClipNode::setStateSetModes() differs
	  from implementation of that function in the constness of the
	  second
	  parameter.
	  On SunOS it compiles fine, but I get link errors when the variant
	  that is
	  declared in the header is referenced.
	  
	  The attached src/osg/ClipNode.cpp file removes the const
	  qualifier from the
	  implementation to match exactly the prototype in the header file.
	  The file is based on revision 7386 as of today.
	  "

2007-09-11 13:34  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "File Changes:
	  - GL2Extensions, Program and Program.cpp
	  
	  Features:
	  - Support for fragment output binding. (e.g. You can now specify
	  in the fragment shader varying out vec3 fragOut; fragOut =
	  vec3(1,0,1); to write to the fragOut variable. In your program
	  you call glBindFragDataLocation(program, 1, "fragOut") to bind
	  the fragOut variable with the MRT 1 - GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT)
	  
	  - new methods Program::add/removeBindFragDataLocation
	  Program::getFragDataBindingList
	  
	  "

2007-09-11 12:04  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "Features of the patch are:
	  
	  - Implementation of integer textures as in EXT_texture_integer
	  
	  - setBorderColor(Vec4) changed to setBorderColor(Vec4d) to pass
	  double values
	  as border color. (Probably we have to provide an overloading
	  function to
	  still support Vec4f ?)
	  
	  - new method Texture::getInternalFormatType() added. Gives
	  information if the
	  internal format normalized, float, signed integer or unsigned
	  integer. Can
	  help people to write better code ;-)
	  
	  "
	  
	  Futher changes to this submission by Robert Osfield, changed the
	  dirty mipmap
	  flag into a buffer_value<> vector to ensure safe handling of
	  multiple contexts.

2007-09-11 10:16  robert

	* From Rafa Giatan, "Changed int to GLsizei in the input parameter
	  of the method
	  osg::Texture2DArray::applyTexImage2DArray_subload inside

	  void*.
	  
	  Moved various OSG classes across to using setGLExtensions instead
	  of getGLExtensions,
	  and changed them to use typedef declarations in the headers
	  rather than casts in
	  the .cpp.

	* Moved defined from Texture2DArray into Texture

2007-09-07 11:21  robert

	* From Art Tevs,
	  
	  "A new texture class Texture2DArray derived from
	  Texture extends the osg to support the new
	  EXT_texture_array extensions. Texture arrays provides
	  a feature for people interesting in GPGPU programming.
	  
	  
	  Faetures and changes:
	  
	  - Full support for layered 2D textures.
	  
	  - New uniform types were added (sampler2DArray)
	  
	  - FrameBufferObject implementation were changed to
	  support attaching of 2D array textures to the
	  framebuffer
	  
	  - StateSet was slightly changed to support texture
	  arrays. NOTE: array textures can not be used in fixed
	  function pipeline. Thus using the layered texture as a
	  statemode for a Drawable produce invalid enumerant
	  OpenGL errors.
	  
	  - Image class was extended to support handling of
	  array textures
	  
	  Tests:
	  I have used this class as a new feature of my
	  application. It works for me without problems (Note:
	  Texture arrays were introduced only for shading
	  languages and not for fixed function pipelines!!!).
	  RTT with Texture2DArray works, as I have tested them
	  as texture targets for a camera with 6 layers/faces
	  (i.e. replacement for cube maps). I am using the array
	  textures in shader programming. Array textures can be
	  attached to the FBO and used as input and as output."

2007-09-07 10:50  robert

	* From Daniel Sjolie, "I patched the zip plugin to make use of my

	  improvement to the pfb plugin
	  CmakeLists.txt and to the FindPerformer.cmake module.
	  
	  Under Windows libs are: libpf.lib (we need to add the lib prefix)
	  and
	  libpfdu-util.lib (libpfdu and libpfutil are compiled into one
	  lib)
	  We need to add PFROOT to the search path for libs and includes
	  (default
	  environment variable for Performer path)
	  And at last we need to put PFROOT/include and
	  PFROOT/include/Performer
	  as include dir for compiling."

2007-09-07 09:53  robert

	* From Maria Ten, fix lat/long usage.

	  dev release till
	  this is resolved I've optional compiled out the problem section.
	  The #define DISABLE_PROBLEM_COMPILE_SECTIONS is used to compile

	* From Galen Faidley," Please find attached the modifications to
	  get the new checkerboard
	  stereo format to work. It's a good thing I tested these on a TV
	  before submitting them since I did indeed have a bug. One thing I
	  did not test was to see how this would work in windowed mode.
	  Does
	  the interlaced stereo code have support for 'absolute' positions?
	  For example a given pixel on the screen is always shown in a
	  given
	  eye no matter where the graphics context is placed?
	  "

2007-08-23 14:10  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay,"As discussed yesterday on the osg-users
	  list, I have altered
	  src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp to implement the official Windows DLL
	  search
	  order as described on the page
	  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx . As
	  mentioned,
	  the search order is now:
	  1. The directory from which the application loaded.
	  2. The system directory. (C:\Windows\System32 by default, gotten
	  using the
	  GetSystemDirectory function)
	  3. The 16-bit system directory. (C:\Windows\System by default,
	  gotten by
	  adding "\System" to the path gotten in the next step...)
	  4. The Windows directory. (C:\Windows by default, gotten using
	  the
	  GetWindowsDirectory function)
	  5. The current directory. (".")
	  6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
	  variable. (as
	  before)
	  
	  The first four directories are obtained using Win32 API calls, so
	  they
	  should work correctly even on non-standard Windows installs.
	  
	  The changes are well commented and should be clear, even to
	  someone
	  not familiar with the Win32 API.
	  
	  I have tested in a few scenarios and it works as expected. Serge
	  Lages
	  has also tested the changes and confirmed they worked as
	  described. I
	  have not had any other reports though (positive or negative).
	  
	  I also fixed the issue with a trailing semicolon on the PATH
	  adding an
	  empty string to the end of the search paths, as this was an
	  inconsistent side effect rather than a desirable effect. This
	  change
	  will take effect on other platforms as well, but since it tests
	  for an
	  empty string in the last item added to the search paths, it
	  should
	  have no adverse effect.

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "After a bit more testing, it was still
	  not 100% robust, so this fix
	  will bring the change in line with what is done on other OSes
	  (Linux)
	  and works in all tested cases.
	  
	  For reference, this was tested with:
	  
	  osgviewer <file>.wrl (file in current directory)
	  osgviewer <dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child directory, relative)
	  osgviewer .\<dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child directory, specify
	  current)
	  osgviewer <drive>:\<dir>\<file>.wrl (absolute path)

2007-08-16 14:13  robert

	* From Maria Ten, "I divide the init method of the
	  geometrytechnique in submethods to made more easy the inheritance
	  between the user and osg-class. This is a first step to add more
	  functions in osgTerrain. Maybe the subdivision of the method have
	  to
	  be in the terraintechnique because is the base class of
	  GeometryTechnique. If Robert or anyone think that this is better
	  i
	  change this class too."

2007-08-15 15:11  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching a little hack from Jean-Sebastien
	  Guay which allows
	  absolute paths to work on Windows."

2007-08-15 15:07  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "the softshadowmap-implementation does not
	  compile on os x, to be more
	  precise, the shader does not compile on os x because of some
	  type-conflicts ala "can not convert from const int to const
	  float"
	  
	  So I changed the offending lines to force the type of the vars.
	  It works
	  now on OS X (albeit very slowly, 3fps on a 7300), perhaps you
	  find the
	  changes useful. Note: perhaps there is a better way in shaders to
	  cast/convert from int to float and viceversa."

2007-08-15 15:03  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "The attached file updates the framestamp
	  and traversal number of the
	  updatevisitor in osgViewer::Viewer.
	  
	  The bug prevented DOF animations because osgSim::DOFTransform
	  checks
	  the traversal number before doing any updates."

2007-08-14 17:13  robert

	* Changed the plugin name to lower case to be consistent with the
	  way that osgDB::Registry
	  searches for only lower case plugin names.

	* Updated version for 2.1.5 dev release

2007-08-13 10:31  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "I've done 2 main modifications :
	  1) added texture->setResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint(false); when loading
	  an
	  image. It speeds up by 10 the loading of large images.
	  2) added a --disk option : only a filelist is read, images are
	  only
	  loaded when needed. It allows to handle very large set of very
	  large
	  images that would not fit in memory. Nothing change when the
	  option is
	  not set."

2007-08-13 10:27  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching an improved version of the
	  OpenVRML plugin. It still uses
	  OpenVRML 0.14.3 and is without the Boost dependency.
	  
	  The changes:
	  - - Fixed loading of textures and normals when no corresponding
	  indices
	  are specified. It uses vertex indices now, compliant with the
	  VRML spec.
	  - - Added colour per vertex support.
	  - - Added group node support.
	  - - Changed the code to use osg::ref_ptr instead of naked
	  pointers to
	  avoid memory leaks.
	  - - Fixed breakage for loading files specified by relative path."

2007-08-13 10:20  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, fix of GDAL location search

2007-08-13 10:17  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I added the ability to set the render
	  target implementaion on the
	  osgSim::OverlayNode. The attached changes were made against the
	  2.0
	  release."

2007-08-13 09:13  robert

2007-08-12 12:15  robert

	* Added fix for typo of name in submission

2007-08-12 12:12  robert

	* From Bruno Hebelin,
	  
	  "I have adapted to osgShadow the soft shadow map technique
	  described in "Efficient Soft-Edged Shadows Using Pixel Shader
	  Branching" by Yury Uralsky, Chapter 17 of GPU Gems 2 (Matt Pharr
	  ed. Addison-Wesley).
	  
	  Here is my code in attachment: basically, it works in the same
	  way as osgShadow/ShadowMap (core code is copied from it) but
	  implements a specific GLSL shader for the soft rendering of
	  penumbra.
	  
	  I have tested it under Linux with a NVidia graphic card, but
	  there should be no dependency on platform nor on the graphics
	  driver (as far as they support GLSL 2). Screenshots attached show
	  the current results (frame rate bound to v-sync, but the shader
	  takes actually not much time)."

2007-08-11 17:44  robert

	* Added preprending of osgPlugins-version to plugin names

2007-08-11 14:49  robert

	* Added DisplaySetting::s/getCompileContextHint() and use of this
	  hint in osgViewer::Viewer/CompositeViewer.
	  
	  Removed the CustomViewer in osgterrain example as the above now
	  removes the need for it.

2007-08-11 12:43  robert

	* Refactored the use of the MasterOperation so that it now gets
	  attached to the
	  Viewer via the new Viewer::addUpdateOperation() method, rather
	  than need a
	  custom Viewer::updateTraversal().

2007-08-11 10:28  robert

	* Added support for an update OperationQueue to Viewer and
	  CompositeViewer to allow asyncrnous adding of operations to be
	  added
	  to the view to be done during syncronous updateTraversal().
	  
	  This feature can be used for doing things like merging subgraphs
	  that have been loaded
	  in a background thread.

2007-08-10 17:44  robert

2007-08-07 14:49  robert

	* From Luc Fruciel, "Gdal plugins reads lots of information that is
	  not taken into account in ReadHeigthField for example.
	  Attached a modification that read the HeigthField position and
	  X,Yintervals.
	  I also removed the limitation to 1024*1024 to 4096*4096, because
	  when you are preprocessing your data with OSG, it can be useful
	  to read large images/heigthfields. Is there a reason (other than
	  hardware limitations for textures) for this limit ?"

2007-08-07 10:37  robert

	* Re-introduceed GDAL plugin

	* From Tim More, "This patch causes GraphicsWindowX11 to not send
	  key release events when a key
	  press / release is caused by auto-repeat. This is consistent with
	  Windows and Mac
	  behavior, as well as other toolkits such as SDL."

2007-08-05 14:51  robert

	  sockinet.cpp to better deal with
	  various operating system differences between socklen_t and int

	  void * in a known pointer (for example osg::Geode *), I has
	  searched an elegant way to introduce this feature.
	  
	  I just add ReinterpretCastConverter in the Reflector to convert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "Attached is an unitialized variable fix

	  causing potential problems if setCursor() was called before
	  anything else set it."

2007-07-25 10:12  robert

	* From Parag Chaudhur, "In daeRMaterials.cpp in the COLLADA plugin,
	  in the processTexture function, Lines 519-522
	  of the source file:
	  
	  The "delete [] path" appears before the "osg::notify", causing
	  the data pointed to by
	  "filename" to be deleted before access causing an access
	  violation.
	  
	  ...

	* From Michael Hartman, "Here is an update for the closing issue
	  with the example osgviewerMFC where the MFC rendering thread
	  would not exit before the application and the thread would be

	  TaskManager to kill the process.
	  
	  Changes:
	  
	  MFC_OSG.cpp:

	  I've also added a little offset to the windows' positions so that

2007-06-30 16:19  robert

	* From Mike Connell, "This is a tiny fix for win32.
	  
	  The current code takes the mouse cursor position and adds it to
	  the
	  window (left,top) position, and sends the mouse cursor there. But
	  this
	  doesn't take into account the window decoration.
	  
	  The new code converts the given (x,y) coordinates from the client
	  area
	  coordinate system to the screen instead using ClientToScreen. I
	  think
	  this is the natural windows way to do it.
	  
	  Tested on XP with osgviewer
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robet Osfield, made a few changes to layout to make it
	  more consistent
	  with the rest of the OSG and used #if 0 instead if (0) blocks.

2007-06-30 14:21  robert

	* From David Callu,
	  
	  "
	  Found in the join file the fix for the bug found by Rafa.
	  
	  
	  Problem :
	  
	  osgIntrospection::Value grp(new osg::Group);
	  
	  osgIntrospection::ValueList vlcall;
	  vlcall.push_back(osgIntrospection::Value("toto"));
	  
	  const osgIntrospection::MethodInfo *m =
	  grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod("setName", vlcall, true);
	  
	  if (m)
	  {
	  m->invoke(grp, vlcall); // ** SEGFAULT here
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Algorithm explanation :
	  
	  The "invoke" method try to convert "grp", which reflect an
	  "osg::Group*", in a
	  "osgIntrospection::Value", which reflect a "osg::Node*".
	  This because
	  the "setName(const char *)" method found by
	  "grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod"
	  is an "osg::Object" type method.
	  
	  When osgIntrospection do this conversion it try :
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to converte an Enum to int or unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then converte this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Bug :
	  
	  1)
	  When osgIntrospection try to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter"
	  It could do any downcast or (Type to SuperType) or upcast
	  (SuperType to Type).
	  This mean the the chain could be :
	  osg::Group to osg::Transform to osg::Camera to
	  osg::CullSettings to osg::CullStack to
	  osg::CollectOccludersVisitor to
	  osg::NodeVisitor to osg::Referenced to osg::Object
	  
	  During the convertion with this chain, A METTRE failed and
	  the pointer in
	  "grp" is set NULL. But the "grp" is always a valid
	  "osgIntrospection::Value"
	  and so, osgIntrospection accept the conversion. Then it try
	  to use this pointer
	  to call the "setName" function. And Bing SEGFAULT.
	  
	  
	  2)
	  In "bool Reflection::accum_conv_path( ... )"
	  the convection path isn't accumulate in the recursive loop.
	  this cause multi request of a conversion path, and a
	  slowdown in the
	  conversion algorithm.
	  
	  3)
	  Use of the last conversion way in a conversion from
	  pointer to pointer
	  this mean you can do this :
	  "osg::Node*" to " value string representation" to
	  "osg::Material*"
	  What a bad thing !!!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Solution :
	  
	  1)
	  Introduce the concept of dynamic_cast and static_cast.
	  now, to do a conversion, osgIntrospection does this :
	  
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with static_cast, downcast (Type to SuperType)
	  
	  - to found, if the source and the destination are two pointer,
	  a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with dynamic_cast, upcast (SuperType to Type)
	  
	  - to convert an Enum to int or to unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then convert this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  Add the "enum CastType" to distinguish the static_cast or
	  dynamic_cast converter.
	  Add file OpenSceneGraph/include/osgIntrospection/CastType
	  
	  2)
	  add a line to accumulate converter in converter Path.
	  
	  3)
	  add a line to check if source and destination are pointer.

2007-06-10 20:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-06-10 19:53  robert

	* From Stephan Huber and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  Stephan: "attached you'll find some modifications to the
	  GraphicsWindow-class and
	  their platform-dependant implementations.
	  
	  The problem:
	  setWindowRectangle and setWindowDecoration do not update the
	  traits-object, so, if you call setWindowRectangle on a
	  not-realized-window it will open with another size when realized
	  later.
	  getWindowRectangle reports possible wrong sizes if
	  setWindowRectangle
	  called before.
	  
	  My solution:
	  split the implementation in two parts:
	  GraphicsWindow::setWindowRectangle will update its traits-object
	  and
	  call afterwards the virtual method
	  setWindowRectangleImplementation
	  (which is implemented by the derived platformspecific classess).
	  For
	  setWindowDecoration I am useing a similar mechanism.
	  
	  I hope you'll find the submission useful, the Win32 and X11
	  changes are
	  not tested but should work."
	  
	  Changes to this made by Robert are call of resized in
	  setWindowRectangle
	  instead of setting of Traits, and use of a bool return type.

	  "

2007-06-08 10:58  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "We have a few OpenFlight files that used to
	  display properly with the
	  old loader, but appear very, very wrong with the new one. I
	  traced the
	  problem to the handling of the palette override flags in the
	  external
	  reference records. The current behavior for handling the palette
	  override flags for external references has different offsets for
	  different OpenFlight version (2 bytes for 14.2-15.1 and 4 bytes
	  for 15.2
	  and later). However, I believe this behavior is incorrect.
	  
	  I know that the original 14.2 OpenFlight spec (dated April 1995)
	  specifies 2 bytes between the filename and the override flags,
	  and the
	  15.4 and later specs specify 4 bytes. However, I also found a
	  14.2.4
	  OpenFlight spec (dated January 1996) that changes the
	  specification to 4
	  bytes. Also, the databases in question were created using an old
	  IRIX
	  version of MultiGen II, which wrote OpenFlight 14.2 files
	  natively.
	  These files also have 4 bytes between the filename and flags.
	  Furthermore, these databases have always worked properly under
	  earlier
	  versions of OSG, under Performer, and in every MultiGen product
	  we've used.
	  
	  This leads me to believe that the original 14.2 spec was
	  incorrect (the
	  14.2.4 spec corrected this error), and there should be 4 bytes
	  between
	  the filename and flags for all OpenFlight files version 14.2 and
	  later.
	  
	  The attached fix modifies the OpenFlight loader to behave in this
	  way."

2007-06-08 10:42  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-06-08 10:22  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "This changes the handling of textures in the
	  OpenFlight loader.
	  Currently, if the texture attribute file doesn't explicitly
	  specify an
	  internal format, the loader will force it to use GL_RGB, which
	  keeps
	  translucent textures (eg. GL_RGBA textures) from showing up
	  properly.
	  
	  This patch changes the default behavior to simply use the image's
	  format
	  instead of forcing a particular format."

2007-06-08 10:16  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "So, something strange happened to the repo and
	  some of this project's
	  files got messed up, most notiably the Nib and also the Localized
	  strings file. I didn't notice the latter until now so Martin is
	  missing this file.
	  
	  Anyway, the attached tar contains all new versions of all the
	  necessary files. There are cleanups and fixes to a lot of things.
	  Martin did a good job porting the thing to osg::Viewer so most of
	  the
	  code changes I made address other areas.
	  
	  Two things I noticed in the new port you might want to consider
	  as
	  feedback. First, there might be a bug with osgViewer when the
	  view
	  size goes to 0. If you play with the splitviews in this program
	  and
	  shrink the view until it is closed, and then re-expand it, the
	  model
	  doesn't come back, not even after a home() call. SimpleViewer
	  didn't
	  have this problem.
	  
	  Second, a more minor thing, this program has a
	  take-screenshot--and-copy-to-clipboard feature via Cmd-C (or Menu
	  item). I achieve this by using osg::Camera to render to an FBO
	  and
	  then copy the contents to Cocoa. To insert the camera, I
	  manipulate
	  the scenegraph so I can get the camera node in and out. I end up
	  calling setSceneData at the end of eveything to restore
	  everything to
	  the original state before I started mucking with the scenegraph.
	  This
	  unfortunately, triggers a home() reset. So in this particular
	  case, it
	  make Copy look like it's changing the scene. The old SimpleViewer
	  had
	  the same problem, but I was able to work around it by directly
	  invoking the underlying SceneView's setSceneData so the home()
	  mechanism was bypassed. The viewer design seems to protect this
	  data
	  more carefully so the bypass trick won't work. My feedback is
	  that
	  maybe a flag or extra parameter can be introduced so a reset is
	  not
	  triggered if not desired.
	  
	  I have checked in a ton of Xcode fixes for the entire build
	  process in
	  general so once this piece gets checked in, hopefully everything
	  will
	  build cleanly."

2007-06-08 10:11  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This change to genwrapper and
	  osgIntrospection gives access to
	  the declaring file for a given type via the new member function
	  osgIntrospection::Type::getDeclaringFile. This information is
	  useful
	  in order to know what header to include when auto-generating
	  wrappers
	  for a given type.
	  
	  During the C# wrapper generator development I've been keeping the
	  declaring file configuration state up-to-date manually with
	  changes
	  to OSG, and it's proven to require substantial effort. So it
	  would be
	  extremely valuable to get this change in before 2.0 to reduce
	  maintenance
	  during the lifetime of the release. It'll also be equally useful
	  to
	  others looking to create wrapper generators using
	  osgIntrospection.
	  
	  This is a fairly simple change and was tested with a fresh
	  rebuild of the
	  entire suite of osgWrapper libraries, so it should be relatively
	  low risk
	  (fingers crossed)."

	* Added clean up of the view before destruction of the window

2007-06-08 09:17  robert

	* Changed the version to 2.0.0 in the Info.plist in anticipation of
	  the official release.
	  I don't know what the OpenThreads version number will be, so that
	  has been left alone.

2007-06-08 04:57  ewing

	* Lots of various fixes to Xcode project.
	  
	  - Adding missing header files and making sure they are marked
	  public.
	  
	  - Support to copy headers in Viewer/api into the proper location
	  in framework
	  
	  - Internalized OpenThreads build so cross-project dependency is
	  not needed. Can now delete copy of OpenThreads project.
	  Frameworks use native Xcode linking mechanism. Plugins/Examples
	  still use explicit -framework OpenThreads. Could potentially be
	  problem is old OpenThreads is on the system. This can be changed
	  to use native mechanism too, but requires some patience because
	  it is tedious to change.
	  
	  - Lots of fixes to osgViewerCocoa (something got messed up pretty
	  badly...files are missing from repo). Another submission will
	  need to readd these files back.

	* From J.P Delport, "attached find an updated osgunittests.cpp that
	  allows for the testing of

	  well
	  as a rotation.
	  
	  The scale can optionally be switched off, see the top of
	  testQuatFromMatrix().
	  
	  As expected, all the current methods for mat to quat conversion
	  fail
	  these new tests. When the scale is omitted, mk2 of getRotate with

2007-06-01 21:33  robert

	* From Maria Ten, "The constructor method of the EllipsoidLocator
	  of osgTerrain assumes
	  that the terrain is always the Earth planet. I changed the
	  constructor
	  method to accept the Equator radius and the Polar radius like
	  parameters. By default, it assumes the Earth radius for the
	  EllipsoidLocator. I added a setEllipsoidModel method, too.
	  
	  Now, we are developing some libraries for a GIS applicacion, and
	  our
	  libraries can visualize terrains of planets like Mars. I think
	  that is
	  a interesting change."

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I did few tests to see whether adding
	  PreDraw callback would help us with SPI problems when using
	  Viewer. Results were positive so I decided to give it a try and
	  ask you to verify and maybe merge with existing codebase.
	  
	  I added _preDrawCallback member and neccessary access methods
	  plus modified osgUtil RenderStage.cpp to invoke it before all
	  drawInner calls are made. I tried to maintain symmetry with
	  postDrawCallback but you know better where is a proper place for

2007-06-01 19:43  robert

	* From Mathias Froelich, "have done an interface to change the
	  mouse cursor in the X11 graphics
	  window.
	  The win32 implementation is still in its original shape since I
	  have no win32
	  implementation available.
	  
	  I have chosen the enum approach for the first cut. That is
	  benefitial since
	  the user does not need to track creation of mouse cursors for
	  different
	  windows and displays in presence of multiple viewer windows.
	  
	  The default set of available mouse shapes is the same set that
	  was available
	  with glut. That set served many OpenGL applications well, so the
	  hope is that
	  this is enough.
	  
	  Even though, that implementation is still extensible:
	  I have digged out the way SDL defines new mouse cursors and added
	  a still
	  documented out function prototype in the GraphicsWindow that can
	  be used to
	  extend the current implemtation for arbitrary mouse shapes. That
	  is not
	  implemented yet.
	  
	  I hope that somebody with a win32 test system can catch up that
	  implementation
	  on win32."

2007-05-29 10:31  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "The issue itself occurs when a model is
	  tessellated
	  that has greater than unsigned short number of vertexes. An
	  object
	  called vertexPtrToIndexMap contains vertexes and their indexes.
	  This
	  std::map object can obviously hold a quantity that is greater
	  than
	  unsigned short, however osg::DrawElementsUShort objects were
	  being
	  created to reference these vertexes and their indexes.
	  osg::DrawElementsUShort can only hold indexes that are 16-bit
	  quantities.
	  
	  ...
	  
	  proposed_patch_2\tessellator.cpp. This solution examines the size
	  of
	  vertexPtrToIndexMap and selects 1 of 3 possible osg::DrawElements
	  objects: DrawElementsUByte, DrawElementsUShort, or
	  DrawElementsUInt.
	  The main drawback of this particular solution is the code
	  duplication.
	  However, the repair is straightforward."

2007-05-29 10:01  robert

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "recently I discovered that the freetype plugin
	  does not work, because
	  CMake doesn't recognize it properly on windows.
	  
	  1) the header detection on a directory "freetype" fails, it seems
	  to
	  need a filename: "ft2build.h" actually works.
	  
	  2) the 3rdparty I am supplying for FlightGear contains
	  freetype-2.3.4. I
	  added the correct library naming for this particular release.

	* From Blake Williams, "I discovered why the \u2013CompositeViewer
	  option for the osghud example does not work. The run() function

	  assigned, which causes the view with the HUD camera to point
	  somewhere other than where it should. I just added a check before
	  a new default camera manipulator is added to ensure that the view
	  allows event focus before a camera manipulator is added."
	  
	  

2007-05-26 15:42  robert

	* From Charles Cole, "Attached are mods to the OpenFlight plug-in
	  to help further implement
	  the specification. With these mods, blink sequences are now
	  created for
	  flashing light point nodes, either palletized (v.15.8 and later)
	  or
	  non-palletized (15.7 and earlier). Thanks to Brede for his
	  implementation of the palletized light point nodes.
	  
	  There is still work to do on adding the capability to properly
	  handle
	  light point system nodes, but this does add some capability that
	  did not
	  previously exist. So, I wanted to at least submit this and I will
	  hopefully provide the additional capability in the near future.
	  
	  I've tested the code modifications with Visual Studio 2005. I
	  don't
	  have the means to test any other operating system, but I would
	  suspect
	  that there shouldn't be any issue (famous last words). I used the
	  test
	  files that I uploaded to the users forum to test the changes.
	  
	  In addition to the added capability, I changed the light point
	  node
	  radius to the "actualPixelSize" value in the file. Previously,
	  the
	  radius was set to half the actual pixel size (see
	  LightPointRecords.cpp). Not sure why this was the case. But, it
	  was
	  brought to my attention by a co-worker who created the OpenFlight
	  files
	  and was testing them with different viewers. If there's some
	  history
	  for setting the radius to half the size, then this change can be
	  omitted."

2007-05-26 15:17  robert

	* Added exclude of svn directories.

2007-05-25 19:35  robert

	* From Charles Cole, "he attached code
	  implements the LightPointSystem class to allow for the OpenFlight
	  plug-in to read and handle light point system nodes. The behavior
	  is
	  very similar to the old plug-in in that a MultiSwitch node is
	  created to
	  handle the "enabled" flag bit set in the node record. The code
	  also
	  reverts the changes for the actualPixelSize as mentioned above.
	  And
	  lastly, the code requires the previously submitted changes for
	  the
	  plug-in.
	  
	  As for the other changes, I've tested the code with Visual Studio
	  2005
	  and the files that I posted in the users forum.
	  
	  With all of the submitted changes, the OpenFlight plug-in should
	  now be
	  capable of loading files with light point system nodes and the
	  use of
	  palletized light points and non-palletized light points.

2007-05-23 11:05  robert

	* From Peter Hrenka, (note from Robert Osfield, renamed
	  GenericPrimitiveFunctor mention below to
	  TemplatePrimitiveFunctor).
	  
	  "Since we desperately needed a means for picking Lines
	  and Points I implemented (hopefully!) proper geometrical tests
	  for the PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  First of all I implemented a new "GenericPrimiteFunctor"
	  which is basically an extended copy TriangleFunctor which also
	  handles Points, Lines and Quads through suitable overloads of
	  operator(). I would have liked to call it "PrimitiveFunctor"
	  but that name was already used...
	  I used a template method to remove redundancy in the
	  drawElements method overloads. If you know of platforms where
	  this will not work I can change it to the style used
	  in TriangleFunctor.
	  
	  In PolytopeIntersector.cpp I implemented a
	  "PolytopePrimitiveIntersector" which provides the needed
	  overloads for Points, Lines, Triangles and Quads to
	  the GenericPrimitiveFunctor. This is then used in the
	  intersect method of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  Implementation summary:
	  - Points: Check distance to all planes
	  - Lines: Check distance of both ends against each plane.
	  If both are outside -> line is out
	  If both are in -> continue checking
	  One is in, one is out -> compute intersection point (candidate)
	  Then check all candidates against all other polytope
	  planes. The remaining candidates are the proper
	  intersection points of the line with the polytope.
	  - Triangles: Perform Line-Checks for all edges of the
	  triangle as above. If there is an proper intersection
	  -> done.
	  In the case where there are more than 2 polytope
	  plane to check against we have to check for the case
	  where the triangle encloses the polytope.
	  In that case the intersection lines of the polytope
	  planes are computed and checked against the triangle.
	  - Quads: handled as two triangles.
	  
	  This is implementation is certainly not the fastest.
	  There are certainly ways and strategies to improve it.
	  
	  
	  I also enabled the code for PolytopeIntersector
	  in osgkeyboardmouse and added keybindings to
	  switch the type of intersector ('p') and the picking
	  coordinate system ('c') on the fly. Since the
	  PolytopeIntersector does not have a canonical
	  ordering for its intersections (as opposed to
	  the LineSegementIntersector) I chaged the
	  implementation to toggle all hit geometries.
	  
	  
	  I tested the functionality with osgkeyboardmouse
	  and several models and it seems to work for
	  polygonal models. Special nodes such as billboards
	  do not work.
	  
	  
	  The next thing on my todo-list is to implement
	  a an improved Intersection-Structure for the
	  PolytopeIntersector. We need to know
	  which primitives where hit (and where).

2007-05-21 08:01  robert

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "FlightGear/OSG on Windows did not load the
	  Texture Fonts.
	  
	  1) TXF Fonts are binary.
	  2) Do not rely on the result of istream::readsome if buffer _is_
	  empty
	  and no data have been read before."

	* Added static build support to export macros

2007-05-21 06:57  robert

2007-05-20 17:38  robert

	* Introduced VERSION and SOVERSION'ing of libraries.

2007-05-20 13:42  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find some modifications and
	  enhancements to the carbon's
	  implementation of GraphicsWindow:
	  
	  - usage of WindowData, you can specify an existing window to use
	  via
	  osg::Traits
	  - implementation of setScreenResolution and setScreenRefreshRate
	  - implementation of setWindowDecoration when window is already
	  created.
	  
	  There seems to be a bug regarding multiple threads and closing
	  windows,
	  see my other mail on osg-users.
	  "

2007-05-20 12:29  robert

	* Added support for version of the osgPlugins directory, which now
	  gets versioned
	  according to the OpenSceneGraph/CMakeLists.txt and the
	  include/osg/Version settings.
	  These changes mean that the 1.9.5 release will have a
	  libs/osgPlugins-1.9.5 directory.

2007-05-20 11:45  robert

	* Added support for SG_USE_FLOAT_MATRIX and OSG_USE_FLOAT_PLANE in

2007-05-20 11:13  robert

	* Fixed build error under float matrix build

2007-05-20 09:55  robert

	* From Lugi Calori, added control of lib postfix.

2007-05-19 14:00  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "I cleaned the code a little bit and improved
	  the handling of loops:
	  
	  I added a new protected virtual method to ImageStream called
	  applyLoopingMode() which is called from setLoopingMode. The
	  quicktime-plugin has an implementation of applyLoopingMode which
	  sets
	  some flags for the quicktime, so that quicktime handles the loop
	  playback by itself.
	  
	  This has some benefits:
	  
	  + no gaps when looping audio
	  + simplified code
	  
	  Attached you'll find the modified files, hope you'll find them
	  useful."

2007-05-19 13:43  robert

2007-05-19 12:27  robert

	* From Michael Hartman, "I have made a small change to the
	  osgviewerMFC application that resolved most of my home computer
	  issues. It seams that my home computer needed to have the pixel
	  format set with PFD_DOUBLEBUFFER.
	  
	  Also, with the cmake ability you are free to remove the
	  MFC_OSG_MDI.vcproj file.
	  "

	  which handle double click events.
	  I've modified the file submitted yesterday by Andre and not the
	  current SVN version."

2007-05-17 11:48  robert

	* From David Callu, "I have added the uninstall command at the end
	  of the first file,
	  and the configuration file template use by the command is the
	  second file.
	  
	  The command use the cmake_install.cmake file which list all file
	  installed by the install target.
	  this issue come from the CMake FAQ"

2007-05-17 11:04  robert

	* From Michael Hartman, "I have gone in and created a CMakeList.txt
	  file for osgviewerMFC application.
	  
	  Below is the changes made to the included files. The examples
	  CMakeList.txt file was not included but the code change needed
	  for osgviewerMFC inclusion is listed below.
	  
	  
	  
	  CMakeList.txt:
	  
	  This is a little different than other example cmakelist.txt files
	  in that I could not use the setup_example macro. I had to go in
	  and extract out the important parts of the macro and inline them
	  in the CMakeList.txt file so that I could add the WIN32
	  declaration into the ADD_EXECUTABLE() statement. In the future
	  the setup_example macro might be modified to support osgviewerMFC
	  but this is special case so you might not want to muddy the water
	  for one example.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG.h:
	  
	  This file had some small changes:
	  
	  From: #include <osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32>
	  
	  To: #include <osgViewer/api/win32/GraphicsWindowWin32>
	  
	  
	  
	  Also added two new function declarations
	  
	  Void PreFrameUpdate(void);
	  
	  Void PostFrameUpdate(void);
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG.cpp:
	  
	  This file changed only in that I am explicitly showing the viewer
	  run loop and added the two new functions in the MFC_OSG.h file.
	  
	  
	  
	  "

2007-05-17 10:59  robert

	* From Andre Garneau, warnings fixes fo VC++

2007-05-17 10:33  robert

	* From Andre Garneau,"Please find attached changes to have the
	  GraphicsWindowWin32 class
	  selectively set the pixel format for windows that are inherited,
	  following
	  some discussions on the mailing list last week.
	  
	  This is implemented through a new traits flag
	  (setInheritedWindowPixelFormat) with a default state of false (to
	  avoid
	  breaking existing applications). When set to true, the pixel
	  format of the
	  inherited window will be set according to the traits
	  specifications.

2007-05-15 19:45  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This is an other small update for the
	  ac3d loader:
	  - It avoids attaching texture coordinates if there is not texture
	  attached.
	  - It uses DrawArrayLengths instead of multiple DrawElements."

2007-05-15 19:32  robert

	* From Blasius Czink, "when creating windows with decorations
	  (titlebar) the mouse position
	  should be adjusted."

2007-05-15 19:25  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "Attached is a version of
	  src\osgViewer\GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp that
	  allows to render in software. (maybe also in hardware w/o
	  wglChoosePixelFormatARB)"

2007-05-15 17:04  robert

	* Added code to better compute the view frustum that is appropriate
	  for a traversed
	  subgraph.

2007-05-15 17:04  robert

	* Changed back to use find Qt3 and Qt4 separately to avoid QT error
	  reports

2007-05-15 14:55  robert

	* From John Kelso, Added support for new Sequence options.
	  From Robert Osfield, updated the above changes to the .ive loader
	  so that the new addition were tested against the IVE version
	  number

2007-05-15 14:53  robert

	* Added -n/--no-overlay option

2007-05-15 11:31  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I tried the latest developper release
	  1.9.4 and found that I hadn't
	  the osgsimpleviewerQt4 example in my Visual studio solutions...
	  After
	  looking into it it seems that you cannot have both Qt3 and Qt4
	  enabled. After modifying the root CMakeLists.txt to use :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt) which should ask you to choose betwwen Qt3 and
	  Qt4
	  if you have both
	  
	  instead of :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt3)
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
	  
	  I had the project generated. But then due to the way CMake
	  handles Qt4
	  I had to modify osgsimpleviewerQt4's CMakeLists.txt to have the
	  binary
	  link with QtOpengl4. "

2007-05-15 11:25  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a modification to the
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit and
	  setActiveTextureUnit methods of osg::State so they return false
	  if the
	  texture unit is outside the range of allowable units for the
	  driver.
	  Currently, the functions would return true even if the units are
	  invalid. This would cause the osg::State to become out of sync
	  with
	  the actual driver state, which can cause some bugs in certain
	  cases.
	  
	  The change I made would verify that the unit passed to
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit is below GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS, and
	  the
	  unit passed to setActiveTextureUnit is below
	  max(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS,GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS). I
	  modeled this behavior from the OpenGL docs for these commands
	  which
	  can be found here:
	  
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glActiveTexture.xml

	  the event handlers
	  in osgViewer.

2007-05-14 14:41  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here is a ViewerEventHandler file with a
	  collection of helper handlers for osgViewer.
	  Most of the code is from the osgviewer application, I have took
	  the fullscreen handler and the threading one, and I have just
	  added a fonctionality to be able to change the screen resolution
	  in windowed mode."

2007-05-11 08:19  robert

	* From Michael Hartman, " Here is the MFC_OSG example. It is very
	  basic and the community is welcome to enhance/improve this
	  example. There is one bug documented in the Readme.txt file that
	  I just have not had time to solve. Also, the code is built
	  outside of the OSG environment and uses environment variables to
	  get to the OSG distribution headers and examples. That should be
	  the only change a user needs to make to get the code to compile."

2007-05-10 18:07  robert

	* Added supoort for transforming layers by an offset and scale

	* From John Kelso,
	  
	  "Attached are updates of src/osg/Sequence.spp and
	  include/osg/Sequence.
	  
	  I've taken _sbegin/_send/_ubegin/_uend and _step our of the
	  include file
	  and made them local variables in whatever method might need them.
	  
	  I got rid of the _recalculate method as it was only getting used
	  in
	  one place.
	  
	  I also found a cut/paste bug in setMode's START case."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, Also includes some guards against
	  crashes that was occuring in this new
	  code when handling empty Sequences.

	* Added use of OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE for clamping texture sizes.

2007-05-09 10:01  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, with mods of using references by Robert
	  Osfield for efficiency. Submission notes from Mike:
	  "By repurpose, I'm creating a new plugin that uses much of the
	  .osg fileformat,
	  but with some changes. Specifically, I'm creating a ".osgfs"
	  plugin, which
	  represents the scenegraph hierarchy as a filesystem of nested
	  subdirectories and
	  individual files for each node, rather than nested braces with
	  everything in a
	  single monolithic file. I intend to incorporate file alteration
	  monitor events
	  to watch the filesystem for modifications and automatically
	  reload.
	  
	  The problem I'm running into is osgDB is too tightly coupled to
	  the .osg format.
	  osgDB::Output::writeObject() contains literal .osg
	  format-specific strings like
	  "{" to represent the Object hierarchy at too low a semantic
	  level. I propose
	  using virtual methods; my plugin can then derive from
	  osgDB::Output and
	  represent Object hiearchy differently.
	  "

2007-05-09 09:43  robert

	* From Alan Harris, "Registry and Archive
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  This is a simple change to permit databases other than those
	  named
	  "*.osga" to be used. It is hardcoded in read() at present.
	  
	  It is non-critical and does not affect existing program
	  functionality.
	  
	  Registry and Registry.cpp
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  Added a new typedef: typedef std::vector< std::string>
	  ArchiveExtensionList;
	  
	  a list of extensions: ArchiveExtensionList _archiveExtList;
	  
	  and an "add" method: addArchiveExtension(const std::string ext)
	  
	  This is initialised by adding "osga" in Registry() and used in
	  Registry::read() where the list is searched for the extension
	  used.
	  
	  Archive.cpp
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~
	  This submission is a little more tentative. openArchive() is
	  modified to
	  automatically add the filename extension to the Registry
	  extension list.
	  "

2007-05-04 08:45  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a change that does no longer

	  flt files are missing. I'm not sure if it was intentionally
	  removed from the project, so I left the everything in place, but
	  removed the target from the build aggregate targets so it doesn't

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "
	  Here are more changes for the CMake scripts:
	  
	  - I removed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in FindOpenThreads as a follow
	  up to
	  the discussion thread.
	  
	  - I introduced an experimental CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to replace it.
	  
	  - I added CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, and
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to the CMake GUI so users can enter values
	  there
	  instead of in the environment.
	  
	  - I added OPENSCENEGRAPH_*_VERSION variables (MAJOR, MINOR,
	  PATCH).
	  These should be kept up-to-date with the real version numbers.
	  Mac
	  bundles like to have version information so users can find out
	  the
	  version they are running through standard About panels and also
	  automated system reporters for troubleshooting/bug tracking. In
	  theory, this information could be used for library versioning.
	  We should do the same for OpenThreads, but I forgot about it.
	  
	  - I added some Mac Info.plist stuff (which uses the version
	  information).

	* From Martin Aumueller, fixed unused parameter warnings

2007-04-25 09:32  robert

	* From Martin Aumueller, "
	  a collegue of mine noticed that on Windows and X11 the modifier
	  state (such as
	  Alt or Ctrl) would be applied one key press too late: e.g. press
	  & hold Alt,
	  press a, release Alt, press a, press a would generate the key
	  sequence a,
	  Alt-a, a instead of Alt-a, a, a.
	  
	  The problem is also present on Carbon. Moving the call to
	  setModKeyMask in
	  front of the call to keyPress fixed it for me on Carbon and X11.
	  I suppose
	  that this will fix the problem for Windows as well."

2007-04-25 09:21  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "These enhancements make it much easier to control which
	  libraries get
	  found by FIND_ using environmental variables. The problem with
	  the old
	  script was that CMake searches what it considers system paths
	  first.
	  This makes it difficult to override in the case where you might
	  have a
	  stable version in /usr/local, but are trying to build a bleeding
	  edge
	  release in the non-standard location /bleeding-edge.
	  
	  I went to the CMake mailing list hoping to find a good solution
	  to
	  this. Unfortunately, there isn't one, and I have to do something
	  rather bone-headed in the Find module. Basically, I have to run
	  FIND_
	  twice: once with default search paths turned off and my
	  environmental
	  variables listed, and again with standard search paths reenabled.
	  At
	  least it works.
	  
	  I also added a few more environmental variables, specifically:
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  
	  These two variables address the shortcoming of OPENTHREADS_DIR in
	  the
	  case where the include path and library path don't share a common
	  parent.
	  
	  Put all this together, and you can setup an automated shell
	  script or
	  Microsoft .bat file to configure and build your application in an
	  automated step.
	  
	  
	  You still should be able to use the key CMake variables like
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to find things, but it
	  will
	  occur after the environmental paths are searched. The reason for
	  this
	  is that the OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR and OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  are
	  more specific. This prevents the accidental ordering problem
	  where you
	  might use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to find some other component like
	  GLUT,
	  but didn't want to accidentally include an older version of
	  OpenThreads located in the same area.
	  
	  As the ultimate override, you can still pass -DVAR=value
	  arguments to
	  cmake and it will take these above all else. However, it's safer
	  for
	  people to not use these in case we modify the script and change
	  the
	  variable names.
	  
	  Finally, I'm wondering if we can kill the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
	  searches in the Find module. As I've said before, this is kind of
	  a
	  hack and the variable wasn't really intended to be used in this
	  way.
	  And I just got bitten by it in some bad corner cases. The problem
	  is
	  that if you don't explicitly set the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX},
	  CMake
	  sets a default value for it (such as /usr/local). The problem is
	  that
	  /usr/local may not be the place you want searched. If you wait to
	  set
	  the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} in the ccmake GUI, then FIND_ is
	  already
	  run once on ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local. If you were
	  planning to
	  change the value in the GUI, it's too late if you had a stuff in
	  /usr/local because FIND_ already found something and won't change
	  the
	  value when you reconfigure since it is already set. You will have
	  to
	  manually change the value yourself. Furthermore, as another
	  problem
	  example, on the Mac, /Library/Frameworks is supposed to be
	  searched
	  before /usr/local, but ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} kept causing stuff
	  in
	  /usr/local to be hit first which took me a really long time to
	  understand how this was happenning. The work around is that I
	  must
	  push the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} search to the very end as not to
	  conflict with anything else. But I think it would be much better
	  if we
	  removed it entirely.
	  
	  And with so many different environmental variables at our
	  disposal, I
	  don't think we need this one:
	  
	  (Checked by CMake automatically:)
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
	  PATH
	  LIB
	  
	  (Checked by us:)
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_DIR
	  OSG_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OSG_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OSG_DIR

	* From Eric Wing, "lwo must link to osgFX or undefined symbols

2007-04-25 09:14  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "I made a mistake in my IF() checks for
	  FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE.
	  I was using ${FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE} instead of just
	  FOO_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE.
	  
	  In this case, it happened to work out to still be correct, but in
	  general it shouldn't have the ${}. (I really hate this syntax.)"

2007-04-24 19:08  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, Added check for image transluceny to image
	  loaded code, placing
	  the image quad into the transparent bin for images with alpha
	  values.

2007-04-24 19:03  robert

	* From Martin Aumueller, "the new Inventor plugin needs some
	  changes in order to compile against OpenInventor.
	  Just as in the pre-r6419 I used the COIN_BASIC_H define in order
	  to discriminate
	  between the two versions of Inventor.
	  
	  Additionally, I had to change the CMakeLists.txt to use the
	  proper include path.
	  "

2007-04-24 13:12  robert

	* From Jan Peciva,
	  "I was working on a new version of Inventor plugin.
	  It was inspired by the need to get correct and high quality
	  conversion,
	  so I verified the plugin on complex models and made number of
	  serious fixes:
	  
	  - the geometry is not two times on the output file (!)
	  - SoVRMLImageTexture: VRML texture support was rewritten
	  according to
	  Inventor programming practices, since it does not worked
	  correctly on
	  many models (Anyway, thanks for Gerrick Bivins to introduce it.)
	  - osg::ref wrong usage related crash fixed
	  - code cleaning and texture code overhaul
	  - LOD fixes
	  - appended README.txt with all the contributors I was able to get
	  from
	  SVN logs"

2007-04-22 21:18  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "In the "new method" 3DS loader, inverse
	  matrices were applied to
	  vertices, but not normals, which caused some models to appear
	  with
	  normals doubly rotated. I've now added some code to transform the
	  normals."

2007-04-22 20:19  robert

	* Unified the setup of version numbers so that they all are based

	  Added ability for StatsHandler and HelpHandler to support end
	  users setting their
	  Camera's graphics context.

2007-04-20 16:15  robert

	* Added delay between sequential threading model changes to prevent
	  the system from locking up
	  with 'm' is held down, which previous would cause the threading
	  model to be thrashed.

2007-04-16 19:40  robert

	* From Jason Howlett, using suggestion from Robert Osfield,
	  "CullVisitor.cpp was modified, beginning at line 1115. Code was
	  added to
	  check if the camera inherits its cull mask. If not, the
	  CullVisitor sets
	  its traversal mask to the camera's cull mask."

2007-04-12 10:06  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "Adding back missing search paths in

	  Also added a fix to the optional warning flags."

2007-04-12 09:59  robert

	* Added SETUP_COMMANDLINE_APPLICATION and SETUP_COMMANDLINE_EXAMPLE

2007-04-12 09:33  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "Attached is a patch allows access access to the CMake

	  option. Now SETUP_APPLICATION and SETUP_EXAMPLE take an
	  additional
	  optional parameter that specifies if the program is a command

	  application or a GUI application (think: IS_COMMANDLINE_APP).
	  Passing
	  1 means true (is_commandline_app). Passing 0 or omitting the
	  parameter
	  means false.
	  
	  I changed the scripts for osgversion and osgunittests to support
	  this

	  any
	  others?"

2007-04-11 08:35  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "
	  Changes include:
	  
	  A internal cache flag that can be used to detect if this is the
	  first
	  time running the CMake configuration. This is needed to work
	  around
	  stupid CMake UI shortcomings about the UI not reflecting anything
	  you
	  SET unless you use FORCE. But if you use FORCE, you override
	  anything
	  the user may try to set/override unless you have an exception
	  check.
	  It turns out the exception check you need is often the first-run
	  check. This flag is potentially useful for other things too.
	  
	  An optional switch that turns on more aggressive warnings based
	  on
	  your compiler.
	  
	  Some Apple specific stuff for detecting the OS version and
	  enabling
	  Universal Binaries (and some additional compiler flags that are
	  good
	  but gcc version dependent). The version check code is
	  unfortunately
	  really fragile. I need to lobby CMake to return the OS X version
	  number for us. FYI, building Universal will fail with the current
	  CMake release due to a bug, but is now fixed in CVS.

	  linkage, I have used the same macro used in core libs
	  Now the macro used for plugin and examples linking test for

	* From Luigi Calori, "when we link against something that comes out
	  from a Find... we ususally have a variable
	  <LINK_VAR_NAME>available like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY,
	  so I' ve set up a macro that uses the variable name expanded for
	  linking, and test if a variable ${LINK_VAR_NAME}_DEBUG
	  like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DEBUG exists and in case uses it for
	  linking in debug mode.
	  I' ve also set up FindOpenThreads to set up these variables.
	  I had to edit the core libraries CMakeLists to add the calls to
	  the macros used.
	  I' ve tested under MSVC"

2007-03-26 13:00  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This is another weirdo change to support code
	  generation. It brings all the Drawable::supports and
	  Drawable::accepts overloads into the ShapeDrawable scope to avoid
	  errors invoking the ones that are not defined in ShapeDrawable.
	  Currently you'll get compilation errors if you pass a
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor or PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the
	  "accept" function invoked on a ShapeDrawable pointer or
	  reference, since those overloads are only defined in the base
	  class. You'll also get the same error passing a
	  PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the "supports" function. These errors
	  occur because C++ function overload resolution does not cross
	  inheritance boundaries."

2007-03-26 09:48  robert

	  TARGET_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES

2007-03-25 11:47  robert

	  osgIntrospection protected function support. I missed adding the
	  protected/public specifier on a couple recursive invocations, so
	  those functions are not currently returning protected functions
	  for base classes when they should."

2007-03-16 14:28  robert

	* From David Callu, " bug:
	  Lost the functionality to find the real type pointed by a
	  pointer.
	  Ex: a osg::Node pointer point on a osg::Group, if I look for
	  information
	  on the pointer type, the introspection say it is a "osg::Node*".
	  But if I want information on the pointed type,
	  the introspection must return the "osg::Group".
	  
	  
	  This bug come from the
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.
	  In the original version, this function use the member
	  "Instance_base *inst_"
	  like this :
	  typeof(*static_cast<Instance<T> *>(inst_)->_data)
	  
	  But in the new version, this function use the template argument
	  "T":
	  typeof(typename remove_pointer<T>::type)
	  
	  This is a good meta-programming use, but here we need a dynamic
	  request.
	  
	  Moreover the "typeof" macro define in "Reflection" header accept
	  only a type in parameter with the new version.
	  
	  
	  
	  fix:
	  Add the macro "typeofvalue" in "Reflection" header which accept a
	  value or a type in parameter.
	  Restore original code in
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.

	  osg::Drawable::AttributeFunctor,
	  osg::Drawable::ConstAttributeFunctor, and
	  osg::StateAttribute::ModeUsage in osg and osgSim were not being
	  properly reflected in osgIntrospection. This appears to be due to
	  Doxygen not handling nested types from superclasses if they're
	  not qualified when referenced in subclasses.
	  
	  
	  
	  These changes add the necessary superclass type qualification so
	  that Doxygen now recognizes the references."

	* From Brede Johansen, Thanks for the model it helped to understand
	  the problem. In Creator the "Last Frame Duration" is performed on
	  the last frame of the last loop iteration, I tried to use it for
	  the last frame of every loop iteration. As you already have
	  explained we need a custom Sequence node. In the osgSim nodekit
	  we already have a couple of specialized nodes for the OpenFlight
	  format. We need an osgSim::GroupAnimation but I don't have the
	  time right now to take this challenge. Until then I have modified
	  my last attempt to work with the current osg::Sequence node by
	  ignoring the "Last Frame Duration".

2007-02-21 15:15  robert

	* Wojciech Lewandowski: "TexGenNode::TexGenNode( TexGen * texGen )
	  constructor does not initialize ReferenceFrame. I am not sure
	  maybe this was the intent but first constructor does it so I
	  don't see a reson why third one shouldn't."

2007-02-21 14:17  robert

	* Removed debug messages

2007-02-21 13:48  robert

	* Removed the exclusion of CullSettings from the genwrapper.conf,

	* From Stephan Huber, "I added a bool to GraphicsContext::Traits to
	  indicate wether to use the
	  multithreaded-opengl-engine on os x or not. I set its default to
	  false,
	  perhaps other os x users can test this setting with their
	  data/apps, to
	  see if we can enable it by default.
	  
	  I changed also the borderless-window-type, so expos?works
	  correctly."

2007-02-15 15:03  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "The template-argument-list errors look to be
	  due to a lack of spaces in the typeof macro. Here's a new
	  Reflection header which should fix those problems. For
	  consistency I think that's the best solution."

2007-02-15 14:53  robert

	* Reorganised the text comments so that they are shorter length,

	  MethodInfo and an explicit attribute to ConstructorInfo using the
	  implementation strategy that David Callu recommended a few months
	  back (thanks David!). This change updates both genwrapper and
	  osgIntrospection, and assumes the osgIntrospection reference
	  support that's still pending in your submission queue."

2007-02-12 17:14  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "These changes add support for reflection of
	  reference and const reference type representations via
	  osgIntrospection::Type. This covers just the static type

	* From Vivek Rajan, new osgManipulator library, with a few minor
	  tweaks and rename for osgDragger to osgManipulator for build by
	  Robert Osfield.
	  Vivek's email to osg-submissions:
	  
	  "I'm happy to release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG
	  community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they
	  have kindly agreed to open source it.
	  
	  The nodekit contains a few draggers but it should be easy to
	  build new
	  draggers on top of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a
	  SIGGRAPH 2002 course - "Design and Implementation of Direct
	  Manipulation in 3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of
	  the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how the
	  nodekit works.
	  
	  The source code also contains an example of how to use the
	  draggers."

2007-02-10 18:01  robert

	* From Vivek Rajan, MatrixDecomposition implementaion, adapted by
	  Robert Osfield
	  to be part of osg::Matrixf and osg::Matrixd classes.

2007-02-09 16:03  robert

	* Moved the basic ShadowVolume code into osgShadow

2007-02-09 14:54  robert

	* From Yefei He, " I wrote a class derived from CopyOp that
	  preserves the multi-parent
	  structure of scene graphs. I only considered the case of
	  DEEP_COPY_NODES,
	  but it is sufficient for me. It is not the most elegant way -- I
	  used
	  a map to list all the already cloned nodes with multiple parents,
	  to be
	  looked up whenever such a node is revisited. The good part is, it
	  works."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, fixed build problems under Linux 64 due to
	  use of int's to store Node*
	  in internal maps used in above custom CopyOp. Added ref_ptr<>
	  usage to main to
	  prevent memory leaks

2007-02-09 14:35  robert

	* From Joakim Simmonsson, fixed inconsistent newlines

2007-02-09 14:21  robert

2007-02-09 12:08  robert

	* Removed debug message

2007-02-08 22:36  robert

	* From André Garneau, "Attached is a fix for the hang occuring on
	  Win32 when the thread model is changed.
	  
	  The issue was caused by the mutex in the
	  ViewerDoubleBufferRenderingOperation being released even though
	  they were not owned. This was causing the underlying critical
	  section object lock count values becoming negative; the next time
	  the lock was acquired it would block because of that."

2007-02-08 22:31  robert

	* From Brian Keener, fixes for Cygwin filename handling

2007-02-08 20:30  robert

	* From Charles Cole, "The program database filename was changed for
	  the osgviewer application such
	  as to not conflict with the program database file generated by
	  the core
	  osgViewer library. This change allows for both the application
	  and library
	  to be used in debugging mode within Visual Studio. This change
	  has been
	  tested with Visual Studio 2005 (VS8)."

2007-02-08 20:27  robert

	  blows up, with sparks sometimes flying out the

	  I added a simple check for zero size in
	  each of the functions that allocates arrays
	  based on the size variable, and I thought
	  I'd pass it along. Now the program will
	  not die if it encounters an ive file with bad

	  I moved your code into the ctor of the

2007-02-05 10:44  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's my changes to Registry to allow
	  extension alias mapping via a config file. I also attached a
	  sample file that tests the parsing, but this is just FYI and not
	  for inclusion in CVS.
	  
	  To set up extension aliases using a config file, an app calls:
	  osgDB::Registry::instance()->readPluginAliasConfigurationFile(),
	  passing in the file name as the parameter. (Of course this should
	  be done before loading any files whose names depend on the
	  mapping.) osgDB will search for the file using OSG_FILE_PATH.
	  
	  The file should contain a line for each mapping, with the "map"
	  extension first, followed by a space or tab, then the plugin
	  identifier. For example, a file containing this line:
	  
	  flt OpenFlight
	  
	  would map the ".flt" extension to the OpenFlight plugin."

2007-02-02 22:30  robert

	* Convert GraphicsThread/GraphicsOperation to more generic

2007-02-02 12:41  robert

	* Added a concrete osg::DeleteHandler implementation which provides
	  support for
	  retain objects for several frames before deleting them. Also

2007-01-30 14:32  robert

	* From Eric Sokolwsky, "osgText is a useful node kit, but when
	  longer paragraphs are displayed
	  on the screen, it looks more aesthetically pleasing to have a
	  larger
	  gap between lines than is given by default. I added a new
	  parameter,
	  lineSpacing, in the Text class to allow the line spacing to be
	  adjustable
	  by the application. The default value is 0 meaning there is no
	  extra
	  spacing given. The value should be given as a percentage of the
	  character
	  height. A good value for longer paragraphs is 0.25 (25%) or
	  more."

2007-01-30 14:18  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "The osgDB::ReaderWriter and
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options classes have
	  copy constructors that take a const osg::CopyOp rather than a

	  this, based off OSG 1.2.
	  
	  Also fixed duplicate "or" openArchive()'s comment."

	  Added lazy updating of text in StatsHandler HUD to minimize the
	  impact of
	  slow text updating on observed frame rates.

2007-01-30 09:55  robert

	* Added support for per frame alternating the direction that
	  SORT_BY_STATE bins are
	  rendered. The alternation makes it more likely that OpenGL
	  objects will still
	  be in video ram.

2007-01-29 22:59  robert

	* From Vlad Danciu, fixed leaf depth sort functor

2007-01-28 09:17  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This file removes the virtual destructor of
	  osgText::String. It seemed wrong that osgText::String should have
	  a vtable since it is treated like a value type, and any
	  subclasses containing additional data would effectively be
	  subject to slicing during standard usage. This stuck out as an
	  anomaly when classifying the OSG types for C# bindings."

2007-01-27 17:57  robert

2007-01-25 12:16  robert

	* #ifdef'd out the artifical simulation time code

2007-01-25 12:02  robert

	* Added osg::FrameStamp::set/getSimulationTime().
	  
	  Added setting of osg_SimulationTime and osg_DeltaSimulationTime
	  to the uniforms set by SceneView
	  
	  Added frame(double simulationTime) and advance(double
	  simulationTime) parameters to
	  osgViewer::SimpleViewer, Vewer and CompositeViewer.
	  
	  Updated various examples and Nodes to use SimulationTime where
	  appropriate.

2007-01-24 11:18  robert

	* Added ability to generate various cube faces for testing and
	  switch handler to toggle between different models.

2007-01-24 10:02  robert

	* From André Garneau, "
	  
	  
	  
	  * Setup proper pixel format for ATI boards (removal of
	  WGL_SWAP_METHOD_ARB specification from the requested pixel format
	  since unsupported by the ATI driver)
	  
	  * Fix to create sample OpenGL window on the proper display
	  device. This is the temporary window used to choose the desired
	  pixel format. In the previous version, this window was always
	  created on the primary display device, even though it had
	  potentially different pixel formats compared to the target
	  display device containing the window to be created.
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenResolution() method
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenRefreshRate() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::requestWarpPointer() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::useCursor() method and
	  associated trait support. This can be used in two ways; first,
	  when the graphics trait requested indicates that no cursor should
	  be present, a new cursor-less window class is used to create the
	  window. When a cursor-enabled window creation is requested,
	  another window class is used. After creation of a window, it is
	  also possible to toggle the cursor state by using the
	  GraphicsWindow::useCursor method.
	  
	  * The way the mouse behaves is now compatible with the behaviour
	  seen on X11; i.e. when pressing a mouse button, the window where
	  the pointer is located will capture the mouse input and release
	  it only after the button has been released. This results in all
	  mouse movement events being dispatched to the window where the
	  button was pressed initially until it is released. This improves
	  the interaction with graphics windows.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Preparation work has been done to support the ability of moving
	  a window from one screen to another screen and recreating its
	  rendering context when this happens. This has been tested with a
	  mix of NVIDIA and ATI cards and works properly. For the moment
	  being, this feature is commented out due to changes in the core
	  OSG libraries that have been done but need to be submitted later
	  this week for approval by Robert.
	  
	  
	  
	  Upcoming features
	  
	  
	  
	  * Support for moving windows from one screen to another screen
	  seamlessly
	  
	  
	  
	  * Ability to set the window (i.e. the application itself creates
	  the rendering window and passes it to the GraphicsWindowWin32
	  class)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Other miscellaneous items"

	* From Mathias Fröhlich, "Attached is a small change that makes the
	  txf loader render the same resulting
	  text than an other well known txf loader. That means drawing them
	  one on top
	  of the other I can only see differences due to different
	  mipmapping ...
	  
	  That is it introduces an additional gap of 0.1*height between the
	  glyphs.
	  There is an additional mapping between upper and lowercase
	  characters if one
	  of them is not available in the txf file.
	  And we have an artificial blank character that is very often

2007-01-15 09:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz and Geoff Michel, Paul updated Geoff's bug fixes

2007-01-12 22:07  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, "this should be the final version of the
	  qt-plugin ported to windows and cleaned up to avoid crashes on
	  exit.
	  Stephan and I tested it on Mac and Win.
	  Just a couple of notes:
	  
	  * the plugin is able to load both regular 2D images and movie
	  stream. There is a #define QT_HANDLE_IMAGES_ALSO mechanism to
	  indicate whether to use it for images or not. This is defined by
	  default on Mac only, to avoid conflicts with the standard windows
	  plugins. See comments on QTUtils.h
	  
	  * de-initialization of quicktime before exit is now left to an
	  observer, which calls exitQuicktime() when last media loaded with
	  the plugin is released. This prevent a crash on exit without need
	  of any extra call external to the plugin."

2007-01-12 22:01  robert

	* Added explicit to ParticleEffect constructors

2007-01-12 21:44  robert

	  Particle(ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp)
	  
	  with
	  
	  ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp
	  
	  in a couple of places. This should make particle creation and
	  reuse go
	  a little faster without all that memory allocation and copying."

2007-01-12 21:33  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "New features:
	  + Multi-display-support
	  + automatic hiding of the menubar/dock if one of the windows
	  intersects
	  the menubar/dock
	  
	  Bugfixes:
	  + event-handling was done by the first opened window, other
	  windows did
	  not receive events -- fixed
	  + mouse-coordinates were absolute, now they are relative to the
	  window.
	  
	  known bugs:
	  + windows with decoration and in fullscreen-size are moved by the
	  system
	  a little bit, so that the titlebar is accessible/visible. So if
	  you want
	  real fullscreen-windows, don't decorate the window :)
	  
	  I updated the XCode-project-file so all ported examples are
	  linked
	  against osgViewer."

2007-01-09 11:42  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, "New delaunay triangulator attached. I hadn't
	  realised that the erase() method was not erase (first, last) but
	  erase (first, one after the last one you want deleted). This made
	  a big difference; however some of the edges of the terrain were
	  not included as edges in the terrain so I increased the size of
	  the supertriangle, which works but reduces accuracy due to the
	  larger range of coordinates in the supertriangle. (A larger
	  supertriangle forces the triangles using supertriangle vertices
	  to be long and thin, making the triangulation fit the convex hull
	  of the terrain.)
	  
	  The loss of accuracy should not affect 'normal' users with
	  terrains that are roughly square (say up to 100:1 aspect ratio)
	  and where the Z range is comparable to the X-Y range. Retested
	  with Pauls data, amalric's strange polygon constraint and the
	  standard test constraints.
	  
	  I also added 2 tests for routines with a NULL argument passed to
	  them (no-one would usually pass a NULL pointer to these routines
	  unless - as I did in testing- you remove some of the constraints
	  but still pass their pointer to the routine). And I removed 3
	  tests for triangles which are already removed when generating the
	  geometry.
	  
	  NB Paul - the previous delaunay triangulator fails under VS8 IF
	  it has any constraints as it attempts to use some vertices that
	  have already been deleted when applying the constraints to edges.
	  Under VS6 and less rigorous compilers it works as the deleted
	  vertices are still in the points stl::Vector; however any added
	  vertices would replace one of the supertriangle vertices with
	  non-disastrous but wrong results."
	  
	  Note, merged with latest name changes in CVS.

2006-12-21 12:24  robert

	* Cleaned up the includes in the GraphicsWindowX11 header

2006-12-21 12:19  robert

	* Moved the implementation of GraphicsWindowX11 from the head into
	  the src/osgViewer directory.

2006-12-21 11:20  robert

	* Improved the handling of moving the mouse pointer across screens,

	  fixes for case insensitive path names on Windows. Nobody has
	  complained to me about them since I posted them on the users list
	  last week."

2006-12-19 17:30  robert

	* From Mathias Fröhlich, "I have a small update to the 'non convex
	  polygon detection' in the ac3d loader
	  that is used to tell if tesselation is required or if we will
	  better leave a
	  polygon as is. It is still not perfect but catches some more
	  cases."

2006-12-19 17:16  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "minor code comment cleaup/rewording"

2006-12-19 17:06  robert

2006-12-14 16:13  robert

	* From Orhun Birsoy, "In SimpleViewer::frameUpdateTraversal

	  to add -O "plugin options",
	  some fix to osgdem.cpp and osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp
	  
	  These mods should allow to build terrains controlling jpeg
	  compressed
	  imagery embedded in ive files, using something like:
	  
	  osgdemd --image-ext jpeg --RGB_24 -O "JPEG_QUALITY 20
	  compressImageData" ......."

2006-12-07 10:09  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, "I was getting triangulations with the
	  previous delaunay triangulator, but it seems I may have been
	  picking up the wrong coordinates or an old version of my test
	  file (that version is OK when no coordinates lie outside the
	  'terrain' zone). This version is much stricter about memory
	  handling and insertion of extra points."

2006-12-06 21:39  robert

	* From Gerrick Bivins, fixed newly introduced texture setup bug.

2006-12-06 21:29  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, add VS6.0 project file for new quicktime
	  windows port

2006-12-06 14:17  robert

	* From Rick Pingry, "n my application I am walking through the
	  scene graph looking for nodes of a specific name. I noticed there
	  were times when some of the nodes were not named what I had
	  expected. Upon reviewing the code, I noticed this was happening
	  when there was a forward reference to a parented object.
	  
	  The existing code uses a map with object ID's. The original code
	  only applied the name to a node for a new ID only if the node did
	  not already exist in the map. The problem was that there was
	  another part of the code (when a parent was forward declared)
	  that also created the node with the ID in the map, but it did not
	  know its name. I simply made sure that the name was set
	  regardless of whether or not the node was already in the map. "

2006-12-05 22:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-12-05 20:30  robert

	* From Gerrick Bivins, "Changes:
	  --merged with fixes for texture coordinates(is this in CVS/SVN
	  already)?
	  --changed above mentioned fix output level from osg::NOTIFY to
	  osg::DEBUG_INFO
	  --added support for VRML97 ImageTextures.
	  --changed pointers to ref_pointers where possible.
	  --added format (method separated by "//////") for easier
	  reading."

2006-12-05 17:10  robert

	* From Roger James,"I have had another go at the windows specific
	  file name handling in daeWMaterials.cpp. I think I have arrived
	  at a temporary compromise.
	  
	  I have decided to just normalise the drive letter part of file
	  names for the time being and also ensure that names of the format
	  x:/xxxxx are treated as absolute paths. This will cover a lot of
	  cases.
	  
	  I have raised a bug against collada which hopefully should
	  resolve some others. However there are some pathological cases
	  which I have commented on in the code, these will probably never
	  work properly unless there is a significant rewrite of the daeURI
	  functionality. Hopefully they are rare."

2006-12-05 16:45  robert

	* From Rein Kadijk, "While displaying a certain scene, OsgEdit
	  crashed in ProxyNode::traverse() in file
	  OSG_OP_OT-1.2\OpenSceneGraph\src\osg\proxynode.cpp.
	  It turned out that nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() returned NULL;
	  using this pointer to call one of DatabaseRequestHandler's
	  methods is of course illegal.
	  I patched it by adding: if (nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler())"
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, reordered the addition of the
	  nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() check to allow the
	  default traverse() to be called when no database handling is
	  attached to the visitor.

2006-12-05 16:29  robert

	* From Stephan Huber and Riccardo Corsi, port of QuickTime plugin
	  to Windows

2006-12-05 15:41  robert

	* Added use of typedef to help clean up the readability a little
	  and replaced a copy list with a reference.

2006-12-05 15:31  robert

	* From Sylvain Marie, "changed raw pointers to smart pointers in
	  the dxfBlock, dxfTables and
	  dxfSection classes, so their members data are correctly deleted.
	  - changed some methods signatures to pass arguments by reference
	  instead of
	  by value. The performance and memory usage are enhanced (the
	  reader was
	  clogging the heap when reading some large DXF files)
	  
	  The updated files have been compiled and tested with a variety of
	  DXF files
	  on XP with VS2003, but the changes should not disturb any other
	  compiler."

2006-12-05 14:58  robert

	* From Chris McGlone, "PlygonZ copy constructor: added allocation
	  and copying of zarray"

2006-12-05 14:50  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "Currently, the DatabasePager always loads
	  requested Nodes using the
	  default Registry Options object, but it would be useful to be
	  able to
	  request loading with a different Options object. The attached
	  files
	  allow you to do that (based off the OSG 1.2 source).
	  
	  For example, I'm implementing a loader that requires context
	  information
	  when it pages in subgraphs, which becomes significantly
	  complicated when
	  multiple scenegraphs are requesting subgraph loads with different
	  contexts (the loader needs to know which context to use, and the
	  Registry Options needs to be carefully managed so the context
	  settings
	  don't clobber each other, especially in multithreaded
	  situations). Being
	  able to pass an Options instance along with the Node request
	  resolves
	  this problem."

2006-12-05 14:28  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "added a new reader option to replace the
	  texture
	  wrap mode CLAMP with CLAMP_TO_EDGE."

	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector out from
	  include/osgUtil/IntersecionVisitor into their own seperate files.

2006-11-28 16:00  robert

	* Added support for float or double osg::Plane, and the default
	  osg::Plane to double.
	  Performance tests on big models did not indicate any performance
	  penalty in using doubles over floats,
	  so the move to doubles should mainly impact precision
	  improvements for whole earth databases.
	  
	  Also made improvements to osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgSim::ElevationSlice classes

2006-11-28 11:10  robert

	* Fixed fade text memory consumption bug which was due to new
	  RenderInfo being
	  created local to RenderStage and passed on to rendering code
	  which populated
	  the RenderInfo UserData, but without the restoring the new
	  UserData to the
	  main RenderInfo. The local RenderInfo UserData is now passed back
	  to the main
	  RenderInfo.

	* Removed the now redundent dateUtils.h file.

2006-11-28 09:14  robert

	  GraphicsWindowProxy files.

2006-11-27 11:25  robert

	* From Mauricio Hofmam, added support for reading images from all
	  osg::CameraNode attachments in RenderStage.

2006-11-27 09:23  robert

	* From André Garneau, "The file submitted includes a fix to
	  properly support DDS textures compressed under the DXT-1 format
	  when they contain alpha information.
	  
	  Under this mode, each 4x4 texel block can selectively use an
	  alpha component or none. When alpha-enabled blocks are present,
	  this is not reported in the DDPF_ALPHAPIXELS bit in the pixel
	  format flags causing the reader-writer to report the file as a
	  3-components file (GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT). The fix
	  requires looking at each 4x4 texel block to detect the presence
	  of 1-bit alpha encoding. When such a block is found, the internal
	  & pixel formats are reported as GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT
	  instead.
	  
	  
	  
	  See
	  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/Opaque_and_1_Bit_Alpha_Textures.asp
	  for more information."

2006-11-26 22:27  robert

	* Removed check from objectDeleted(void*) method as this was not
	  catching cases
	  where the registered ptr was different from the deleted ptr -
	  something that
	  can happen with multiple inheritance.

2006-11-26 14:17  robert

	* Missed check of changes to the RemoveRedundentNodesVisitor

2006-11-24 21:19  robert

	* Added extra checks to RemoveRedendentVisitor to catch Groups that
	  may
	  only have one child, but also have StateSet's etc and thefore not
	  suitable
	  for removal.

2006-11-24 21:10  robert

	* Added isIdentity() method

2006-11-24 17:20  robert

	* Improved handling of bounding polytope

2006-11-24 11:37  robert

	* Added support for positional lights into

2006-11-22 21:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, add OSG_FILE_PATH to end of setting of
	  OSG_FILE_PATH to preserve any previous settings

2006-11-22 20:52  robert

	* From Paul de Repentigny, "When calling osgdem with argument
	  "--image-ext", the application just
	  returns after loading the proper ReaderWriter for the given
	  extension." Fix was to remove the erroenous return.

2006-11-22 20:47  robert

	* From Sylvan Marie, "I attached my revised dxfEntity.cpp file from
	  the DXF plugin with the 2
	  following improvements:
	  
	  - When all unsupported entities (SOLIDS, TEXT, ...) have been
	  filtered out
	  from a block, dxfInsert::drawScene() was crashing because it
	  assumed that
	  the block was not empty. It now returns silently so the other
	  blocks can
	  still be imported.
	  
	  - The DXF reader assumed all vertices were read first, then the
	  face
	  indices. But, from the DXF "documentation" (www.autodesk.com/dxf)
	  :
	  "Polyface meshes created with the PFACE command are always
	  generated with
	  all the vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face
	  definition
	  entities. The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes
	  requires
	  this ordering. Programs that generate polyface meshes in DXF
	  should generate
	  all the vertices then all the faces. However, programs that read
	  polyface
	  meshes from DXF should be tolerant of odd vertex and face
	  ordering."
	  So now the importer ignores the posted number of vertices and
	  face indices,
	  and uses the size of the lists instead."

2006-11-22 20:39  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added missing initialization of the
	  _scaleByTextureRectangleSize
	  variable in two of its constructors.

2006-11-21 16:16  robert

	* Added removeDuplicates function

2006-11-21 16:15  robert

	* Reordered methods to make associated functions clearer.

2006-11-21 14:42  robert

2006-11-16 16:42  robert

	* From Frashid Lashkari, added support for PointSprites to .ive

2006-11-16 16:25  robert

2006-11-14 16:59  robert

	* From Eric Wing, add use of the autodetection of windowing size
	  support in SDL-version 1.2.10 and later.
	  From Robert Osfield, made the above an optional compile as it
	  breaks apps based on previous version of SDL.

2006-11-14 16:37  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Improovments:
	  - does proper edge detection with the crease angle given in the
	  ac file
	  - the reader is much more verbose in case of broken files
	  - no more static variables
	  - std::stream based
	  - much faster, up to a factor of 50 for a polygonal test model
	  - if the file contains polygonal surfaces the loaded geometry is
	  still
	  polygonal as long as the polygons are convex. Concave polygons
	  are still
	  tesselated. Rationale: If the user needs triangular models he can
	  throw away
	  that extra information with the osgUtil::Optimizer himself. But
	  the read step
	  preserves as much extra information that is contained in the file
	  as
	  possible. Also the polygonal models look a bit smoother than the
	  triangular
	  ones.
	  - a huge cleanup
	  - the basic parsing logic from the original ac3d developer is
	  untouched
	  - the writer part is untouched
	  
	  The tarball contains a replacement for the src/osgPlugins/ac3d
	  directory that
	  is based on the current CVS (2006-11-13).
	  I have tested that loader with a osgconv foo.ac /tmp/xx.ive on
	  everyfoo. ac
	  file I could find (~200 from flightgear and the object database).
	  I also run
	  my flightgear development with that loader -> here I see the
	  models.
	  I run valgrind testcases on some selected models."

	* Added osgViewer depdendency to osgintersection, osgGLUT* examples

2006-11-14 12:55  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I ran though the sample data that Gert
	  provided earlier today and tracked down the problem. The xoffset
	  in readHeightField and readImage were being applied even in
	  projected coordinate systems. This patch should fix the issue."

2006-11-14 12:51  robert

	* Further migration to using RenderInfo

2006-11-14 12:49  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, Follows is required to prevent unidented
	  cloning of shared arrays :
	  "I added some calls to isOperationPermissibleForObject() so I can
	  permit the flattten-pass with my specialized objects in my own
	  code."

2006-11-14 12:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "This patch adds a CoordOriginMode to the
	  osg::PointSprite attribute.
	  The mode needs to be changed to LOWER_LEFT when rendering point
	  sprites to pbuffers or FBOs, otherwise the points will be
	  transformed
	  on the CPU."

2006-11-14 12:16  robert

2006-11-07 13:48  robert

	* Ben van Basten, "1 Bug fix in reuseParticle where originally an
	  old particle that was already killed would be killed again, but
	  instead should have been placed on the dead stack for future
	  reuse.
	  
	  2 Getter/setter for _maxNumberOfParticlesToSkip that is used for
	  filtering of particles during draw. This enables you to turn the
	  filtering of by setting this value to zero.
	  
	  3 Getter for retrieval of the first particle in the trail. This
	  allows you to directly manipulate the trail from your application
	  by walking from the start particle towards the end of the trail."
	  
	  Submitted on Ben's behalf by Roland Smeenk.

2006-11-06 13:22  robert

	* Thanks to Björn Hein for spotting mistakes in EventQueue.cpp and
	  StateSetManipulator, now fixed by Robert Osfield. Problems were:
	  
	  "StateSetManipulator.cpp (rev 1.12, l. 85): cyclePolygonMode() is
	  called but
	  no aa.requestRedraw() afterwards. Is this intended?
	  
	  EventQueue.cpp (rev 1.8): in keyRelease & keyPressed KEY_Alt_R
	  was mapped to
	  MODKEY_LEFT_ALT"

2006-10-30 12:39  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-10-30 12:28  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix to get the proper normals
	  on an md2 model, actually
	  the way it was before would sometimes lead to a crash since it
	  was
	  attaching the wrong array to the geometry..."

2006-10-30 12:23  robert

	* From Vladimir Shabanov, "The DDS plugin didn't correctly read
	  mipmapped A8L8 textures.
	  I've attached a small fix for this.
	  
	  Cause: uncompressed mipmap handling was done only for RGB pixel
	  format.
	  
	  Fix: added condition for handling alpha and luminance formats
	  too."

2006-10-30 12:19  robert

	* From Michael Henheffer, "There's a problem with OverlayNodes
	  where the texture will not display
	  if continuous updating is set to false.
	  
	  The problem was being caused by the camera update call never
	  being made
	  if continuous updating was not set to true. This fix adds a flag
	  that
	  is set when dirtyOverlayTexture() is called and checked in the
	  update
	  visitor section of the traversal to determine if the camera
	  should be
	  updated.
	  
	  I tested the fix by making some changes to the osgAnimate example
	  program so it has continuous updating off and calls
	  dirtyOverlayTexture
	  for each frame. The overlay texture now displays properly."

2006-10-30 12:14  robert

	* From Edgar Ellis, "
	  method may not take the node into consideration when computing
	  its bound.
	  
	  In this case of:
	  switch->insertChild(0, child, false);
	  switch->insertChild(1, child, true);
	  
	  child will not be used in computeBound, but will be drawn.
	  
	  Solution:
	  Changed compute bound to loop over children using an index
	  instead of an
	  iterator. This behaviour matches that of the traverse method."
	  
	  -----------------------------------------------

2006-10-30 12:05  robert

	* From Michael Henheffer, "Bug: The reader would crash when trying
	  to load a .tif image that
	  contained an 8-bit color map. The crash occured at line 545:
	  
	  remap_row(currPtr, inbuf, w, red, green, blue);
	  
	  
	  Cause: The code was trying to write past the end of the buffer
	  while
	  doing this remapping. The size of the buffer is determined based
	  on the
	  value of 'format', which was 1 in this case since bitspersample
	  is
	  8(indicating a 8-bit color map). The buffer should have been
	  created 3
	  times as large since that 8-bit value is indexing a 24-bit color.
	  
	  
	  Fix: I've put in an if statement to set format to 3 if
	  'photometric'
	  indicates the tif contains a palette as the output data will
	  always be
	  24-bit color data in this case."

2006-10-30 11:55  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, fixed osgsimpleviewerQt4 so that it uses

2006-10-21 21:06  robert

	* Fixed OSX x86 endian issue in Quicktime movie plugin.

2006-10-17 15:17  robert

	* From David Callu:
	  
	  "
	  the main problem is the wrapper generation:
	  The PropertyInfo class use MethodInfo class to access to the
	  value.
	  When the property are define with the I_Property* macro,
	  the MethodInfo use by the property to have access to the value
	  are instancied in the I_Property* macro, but there
	  are already instantied by the I_Method* macro before
	  
	  
	  secondary problem:
	  - the function used by the property could no be customized
	  in the genwrapper.conf file
	  - an array property can't insert a value
	  - the std::map reflector (and indexedProperty in general) haven't
	  remove method
	  - about the help in wrapper ... why not ...
	  
	  
	  
	  solution :
	  To use the function define by the I_Method, I add a MethodInfo
	  variable in the I_Method0 macro
	  old macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn) (\
	  params.clear(),\
	  addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodIn
	  fo0<reflected_type, ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn,
	  params)))
	  
	  new macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn, signature, briefHelp, detailedHelp) \
	  params.clear(); \
	  osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature = addMethod(new
	  osgIntrospection::TypedMethodInfo0<reflected_type, ret
	  >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params, briefHelp,
	  detailedHelp)); sink(signature)
	  
	  
	  
	  the osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature is used by the
	  I_Property macro to define the MethodInfo that it use
	  
	  so for I_Property macro :
	  old macro :
	  #define I_PropertyWithReturnType(t, n, r) \
	  cap=addProperty(new
	  osgIntrospection::PropertyInfo(osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(reflected_type)),
	  osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(t)), #n, \
	  I_Method0(t, get##n), \
	  I_Method1(r, set##n, IN, t, value)))
	  
	  new macro:
	  #define I_SimpleProperty(t, n, get, set) \
	  get, \
	  set))
	  
	  The genwrapper has been modified in this way.
	  The method signature is define by the prototype of the method
	  For example, the "const char* libraryName();" have
	  "__C5_char_P1__libraryName" for signature
	  
	  
	  solution for secondary problem:
	  The genwrapper accept new tokens in the configuration to
	  custumize the property.
	  The new PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute
	  class has been defined
	  The PropertyRemover has been added to the StdMapReflector
	  The _briefHelp and _detailedHelp variable has been added in
	  PropertyInfo, MethodInfo and ContructorInfo class
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  modification:
	  
	  I have modify the genwrapper files
	  Configuration.cpp Configuration.h add some tokens to custumize
	  the property
	  Doxyfile.template add the comment in the output xml
	  genwrapper.conf customize some property in osg::Geometry
	  RegistryBuilder.h RegistryBuilder.cpp add the process_help
	  function (to extract help from xml)
	  TypeRegister.cpp TypeRegister.h optimize the property detection
	  TypeDesc.h TypeDesc.cpp modify FunctionDesc and PropertyDesc
	  WrapperGenerator.h WrapperGenerator.cpp modify the output
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  I also modify the fallowing osgIntrospection files:
	  
	  include/osgIntrospection/Attributes add the PropertyInserter and
	  the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute class
	  include/osgIntrospection/ConstructorInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the ConstructorInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/MethodInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the MethodInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/PropertyInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the PropertyInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/ReflectionMacro remove unused
	  I_Property* macro
	  modify all I_Method macro to accept the help string
	  modify all I_Method macro to define a MethodInfo signature
	  include/osgIntrospection/Reflector add the PropertyInserter in
	  StdVectorReflector and StdListReflector
	  add the PropertyRemover in the StdMapReflector
	  include/osgIntrospection/StaticMethodInfo modify all
	  StaticMethodInfo* to accept the help in parameter
	  include/osgIntrospection/TypedMethodInfo modify all
	  TypedMethodInfo* to accept the help in parameter
	  include/osgIntrospection/TypedConstructorInfo modify all
	  TypedConstructorInfo* to accept the help in parameter

2006-10-06 11:02  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-10-06 09:54  robert

	  classes/headers as
	  this classes weren't being actively used the distribution,
	  effectively being noops.

2006-10-06 06:58  robert

2006-10-05 10:06  robert

	* Added osgGA::GraphicsWindow base class that derives from

2006-10-03 20:20  robert

	* From John Aughey, "Attached is the Optimizer.cpp file that has
	  the fix to duplicate vertex and normal arrays if there is more

2006-10-03 19:55  robert

	* From John Aughey, "The id name of nodes are not being set in the
	  daeReader::processNode method. The names are retained in most of

2006-10-03 09:39  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I think some nitpicking is required. The

	  gallery behaves."

2006-10-02 15:59  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I've included render bin checks in the

2006-10-02 14:11  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Here is the patch we discussed previously

2006-10-02 13:40  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The ColorControl of osg::LightModel is

2006-10-02 13:24  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix for loading the same file

2006-10-02 13:07  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a small bug fix in the DW

	  3x2,
	  it's now fixed to 3x3."

2006-10-02 11:47  robert

	* Added SERIALIZER to ReaderWriterDAE to make sure initialization
	  is thread safe.

2006-10-02 11:38  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a modified
	  ReaderWriterDAE.cpp which creates the one and
	  only DAE instance when it's first needed instead of in the
	  constructor.
	  This fixes the problem with osgdb_dae.dll not being loaded due to
	  unwanted ordering of global initialization.
	  
	  This fix and the previous fix of the COLLADA plugin might be
	  unnecessary
	  with the latest COLLADA DOM, but since many of us will probably
	  still
	  use the older version of the DOM, I guess it's better this way.
	  "

2006-10-02 11:34  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "It seems my changes to ESRIShape.dsp (to
	  create an osgdb_shp.dll rather
	  than an osgdb_ESRI.dll) were overwritten by later commits to this
	  file.
	  Here are the changes again, made from the latest version of
	  ESRIShape.dsp."

2006-10-02 11:26  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "There was a bug in ParticleSystem where
	  the bounds is not properly
	  flagged as computed when there is only 1 particle. Attached is
	  the
	  fix."

2006-10-01 19:19  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "These changes break out the implementation of
	  the fill/wireframe/point, texture,
	  lighting and backface culling settings from the event handling
	  code in StatesetManipulator
	  into public methods. The event handler now calls the public
	  methods. This allows user code
	  to invoke this same functionality from non-keyboard event inputs
	  without clashing with the
	  keyboard-invoked functionality."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaks to the above to kepp the coding style
	  the same as the rest of the OSG, also
	  made getPolygonMode() const, and updated the wrappers.

2006-10-01 19:09  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added "billboardCenter" as a reader
	  option to use the center of
	  a billboard as the pivot point."

2006-10-01 19:00  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I have corrected a byte swapping problem in
	  the new OpenFlight
	  plugin. It was only reading floats & doubles correctly on little
	  endian systems, which require byte swapping, and not on big
	  endian systems which don't require any swapping."

	  yet).

2006-09-15 13:11  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "I've fixed the dae plugin so it is only using
	  one instance of the DAE.
	  The crashes seen earlier are gone, it is now possible to read

2006-09-05 08:44  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added an optimization to the
	  OpenFlight plugin. By default it
	  ignores the Object records if it's safe to do so. The reader
	  option
	  preserveObject prevents this optimization.
	  
	  I have also removed the flat shading attribute set by the Object
	  record. This flag is only intended for the "Calculate Shading"
	  operation in Creator."

2006-09-04 20:43  robert

	* Added support for imagery and DEM's that wrap around the
	  dateline, this required
	  two passes over the copying of imagery and DEM's to the
	  destination graphs, once for
	  the original position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees
	  on or before.
	  
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather
	  than -DBL_MAX. This bug causesd the y axis to be computed
	  incorrectly.

2006-09-04 13:35  robert

	* Missing part of Farshid Laskari's submission relating to
	  CameraNode RenderOrder.

2006-09-04 13:22  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-04 13:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari,
	  
	  "I've made some changes to osg which I think make it easier to
	  control
	  the render order of CameraNode's. Instead of using the built-in
	  orders
	  (PRE_RENDER, POST_RENDER, NESTED_RENDER), you can specify an
	  integer
	  order. Values less than zero are pre rendered in order. Values
	  greater
	  than zero are post rendered in order. And a value of 0 is
	  equivalent
	  to NESTED_RENDER.
	  
	  The changes should be fully backward compatible. Also, I changed
	  the
	  RenderStageList type from a vector to a list because I needed to
	  be
	  able to insert values anywhere in the list.
	  
	  The reason I made these changes was because I wanted to be able
	  to set
	  the render order of a CameraNode at runtime without having to
	  reorder
	  it in the scenegraph."
	  
	  and later in the final submission message (relating to what has
	  been finally been merged) :
	  
	  "I've rethought my implementation and came up with something a
	  little
	  better. The setRenderOrder will continue to take an enum, but
	  will
	  have an optional orderNum parameter which can be both positive
	  and
	  negative. I think this method is more intuitive and flexible."

2006-09-04 12:52  robert

	* Cleaned up the texture setup code.

2006-09-04 12:46  robert

	* Added osg::TexMat::s/getScaleByTextureRectangleSize feature that
	  allows
	  one to use the osg::TexMat to automatically scale non dimensional
	  tex coordinats to
	  the size of the last texture rectangle applied.

2006-09-04 06:51  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, removed debug message being written to the
	  console.

2006-09-04 06:47  robert

	* From David Callu, add reflection of std::wstring in the
	  DefaultReflector

2006-09-01 12:52  robert

	* From David Callu,
	  "bug fix to reflect the wchar_t in Value and Value.cpp I add the
	  toWString() function.
	  in Type and Type.cpp I just add two function to get a map of
	  propertyList and a map of methodList
	  i need this map in my editor a i think it's could be util to put
	  this functionnality in osgIntrospection,

2006-09-01 12:46  robert

	* Removed the String inhertiance from osg::Referenced.

2006-08-31 20:55  robert

	* Updated Version number for 1.2 release

2006-08-31 20:54  robert

	* Updated version numbers of the up comming 1.2 release

2006-08-31 20:48  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached is a change for GLExtensions.cpp that
	  allows OS X to use
	  dlopen/dlsym instead of NS*Symbol* functions for 10.3 or later.
	  The
	  latter is now deprecated.
	  
	  I'm not completely sure how to test the changes. But I compiled
	  these
	  new changes in and ran the osgvertexprogram and osgshaders
	  examples
	  and they seemed to display the same results as before.
	  
	  With respect to the use of dlopen and dlsym, I was uncertain if
	  the
	  usage should look like Sun or FreeBSD (or something else).
	  Apple's man
	  pages discourage the use of RTLD_DEFAULT so I avoided the FreeBSD
	  implementation and copied the Sun implementation. I'm not sure if
	  this
	  is correct/ideal or not."

2006-08-31 20:26  robert

	* Updated NEWS for 1.2 release and added COLLADA plugin

	  bloat.

2006-08-30 09:32  robert

	* In TextureAtlasVisitor code added catch for textures that have
	  some geometry with texcoords within 0 to 1.0, but
	  others others out of the 0 to 1 range, these textures are
	  automatically rejected from consideration for adding to a texture
	  atlas.

2006-08-29 15:05  robert

	* To the TextureAtlasBuilder added detection of instance where a
	  single drawable

2006-08-28 19:01  robert

	* From Roger James, "I have been going through my modified osg
	  files and came across this fix to the Tesselator. From memory it
	  handles a problem with per primitive normal binding. I must have
	  forgotten to submit it."

2006-08-28 15:46  robert

2006-08-25 08:48  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari,
	  "I was experiencing hard crashes of my application when using
	  PBO's on
	  machines that don't support PBO's. I think osg incorrectly checks
	  if
	  PBO's are supported.
	  
	  I added a new method to the BufferObject::Extensions class which
	  returns if the "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object" string is supported.
	  This
	  fixes the problem on my end. Machines without PBO support will
	  continue to work and machines with PBO support will still be able
	  to
	  use it."

2006-08-25 08:42  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode project

2006-08-24 20:16  robert

	* From David Guthrie, "I know there are 50,000 changes to osg/Math
	  for OSX a day, but I
	  think it can be simplified quite a bit. The old code includes
	  <cmath> for pre-10.2 and anything using something other than g++
	  4
	  and then uses std::isnan. For the most current version, it leaves
	  out cmath and uses isnan(). std::isnan and cmath work for the
	  current version, so I just made it include cmath if __APPLE__ is
	  defined and removed the ifdef between versions of OS X for isnan
	  related things.
	  
	  This way the code is all the same, and it's not fragile to
	  someone
	  including <cmath> prior to including osg/Math."

2006-08-24 20:15  robert

	* Simplified swap bytes code to make it more efficient.

2006-08-24 16:33  robert

	  directly rather using a series of memcpy.

2006-08-23 15:11  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, fixed typos

2006-08-23 14:17  robert

	* From Daniel Larimer, fix for OSX 10.4 when gcc != 4

2006-08-23 13:32  robert

	* Added osgUtil::Tesselator for SHapeType Polygon to handle concave
	  polygons.

2006-08-22 13:07  robert

	* From Vaclav Bilek, "The purpose of this change is to suppress
	  "re-reading" of osg::ProxyNodes
	  ( in OF external references) after the OF file is loaded. The
	  change do
	  conditional
	  execution of already existing code.
	  
	  I use this for optimized preprocessing of large databases what
	  can not
	  be loaded
	  in one pass because of memory limits."

2006-08-22 12:49  robert

	* From Gary Quinn, updated to take account of new bin directory
	  structure.

2006-08-22 12:46  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, updated to look for lib/win32.

2006-08-22 12:33  robert

	* Changed the default implementation of backdrop text to
	  DEPTH_RANGE and
	  tweaked the depth range values to minimize the depth rage witout
	  causing z fighting
	  on osgtext example.

2006-08-22 10:23  robert

	* From Eric Wing, fix for compute of the bounding box when handling

2006-08-21 15:07  robert

	* Fixed 64 bit support

2006-08-14 19:42  robert

	* Fixed texture optimization problem associated with mixing already
	  compiled scene graphs - resulting
	  in incorrect texture assignment. Solution was to a
	  compareTextureObjects() test to the Texture*::compare(..) method
	  that

	  palettes or Shader
	  palettes, then the parent file is not allowed to override those
	  palettes in
	  the child."

2006-07-31 20:56  robert

	* From Jason Beverage,
	  "I've attached fixes to DataSet that should fix the problems that
	  Maya was seeing yesterday. The issue was that the new
	  interpolation code I submitted didn't use the SourceData's
	  georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a proper
	  geo-ref. I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a member of
	  SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's georef.
	  
	  I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the DataSet
	  header."

	  conditional
	  calling of invert_4x4 or invert_4x3 depending on the the right
	  hand column of the matrix.
	  
	  Updated wrappers

2006-07-27 16:41  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "This patch should fix Gert's problem that
	  he posted on osg-users. I downloaded the sample he posted,
	  reproduced the error, and added an additional check to make sure
	  the GDAL window size was valid. Now his example works fine.
	  Changes made against current CVS.
	  "

2006-07-27 15:23  robert

	* From David Spilling, "Matrix_implementation.cpp modified as
	  requested. I ran a version of it through a local version of
	  osgunittests.cpp and it passes.
	  
	  Note that firstly it always returns the positive real quaternion
	  (positive w)
	  
	  Note also that it will sometimes slightly differ from the results
	  of the other methods because it assumes that the input matrix
	  really is a rotation matrix - if it isn't, e.g. because of
	  rounding error, then the output quaternion will be very slightly
	  different. For example, the test matrix
	  
	  0 1 0 0
	  1 0 0 0
	  0 0 0.999999 0
	  0 0 0 1
	  
	  will return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0005033 0.0005033
	  
	  whereas the previous methods return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0 0.0
	  
	  However, since quaternions are rotations, the meaning of how to
	  convert a matrix that isn't a rotation is a little unclear..."

2006-07-27 12:32  robert

	* From Michael Polak, double click fixes/additions

2006-07-27 11:58  robert

	* From Eric Wing, add outline to help text to make it easier to

	* Remove ERSIShape directory.

2006-07-27 11:22  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "The ESRIShape plugin needs to produce a
	  osgdb_shp.dll rather than a
	  osgdb_ESRI.dll in Windows in order to find the correct library
	  when
	  loading shp files. A new dsp file is attached to this mail. Also,
	  the
	  ERSIShape folder should be deleted."

2006-07-12 09:40  robert

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  
	  "I found some artifacts on some models and traced it back to the
	  external palette override feature. There are some changes in the
	  layout of the external record the loader have to take into
	  consideration.
	  
	  The other fix is to remove the OF pools from the user data of the
	  external ProxyNode when it is no longer needed."

	  make it consistent with the constructor and prevent the
	  BlendFuncSeparate path being called. This patch fixed the
	  artifact
	  with the osgpointsprite demo on ATI cards reported by Mike
	  Weiblen."

2006-07-11 10:34  robert

	* From Antoine Hue,
	  
	  "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()", appear to be a
	  getter =>
	  "int getNotifyOffset()".
	  
	  Then I have added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when
	  the
	  current notify level + local offset permit message display. In
	  fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet
	  is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite disturbing
	  since
	  you think the progress is related to the complete processing but
	  it is
	  actually only related to the GDAL Warp."

2006-07-06 14:14  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky,
	  "If a texture is used that is not a multiple of four, and
	  compression
	  was requested through the texture's internal format, the
	  texture's
	  internal format reverts to a non-compressed type and a NOTICE is
	  given.
	  At present, compressed textures must have a multiple of four in
	  each
	  dimension."

2006-07-06 14:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-07-06 14:02  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky,
	  
	  "Attached is some fixes for Image::readImageFromCurrentTexture.
	  It was
	  failing when used with a new Image object (some of the fields
	  were
	  not set before they were used, and some were set to the wrong
	  values).
	  A new optional parameter was added to give the desired data type,
	  which
	  defaults to GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, so programs should only need a
	  recompile
	  to work properly."

2006-07-06 13:06  robert

2006-07-06 09:11  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updaetes to Xcode projects

2006-07-06 08:36  robert

	* From Vivek Rajan, "Rotated text in SCREEN_COORDS was looking a
	  little squished especially
	  in orthographic projection. Performing the rotation before the
	  scaling
	  fixed the problem. I've attached Text.cpp with the fix."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, in keeping with Vivek's change moved the
	  auto rotate to screen befor the scale as well.

2006-07-05 21:52  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The attached Texture.cpp fixes a problem
	  when subloading compressed
	  textures. Near the top of the function that implements texture
	  subloading, osg::Texture::applyTexImage2D_subload(), the local
	  variable
	  compressed_image examines the _image's_ pixel format to see if it
	  is
	  compressed. However, further on, in calls to getCompressedSize()
	  the
	  _texture's_ pixel format is used. In my application's Texture2D
	  class,
	  I use osg::Texture::USE_ARB_COMPRESSION to
	  osg::Texture2D::setInternalFormatMode(), which causes the
	  internal format
	  to become one of the generic ARB_COMPRESSED types, which do not
	  have a
	  specific size. Thus the recent warning message added to
	  osg::Texture::getCompressedSize() is triggered. The correct
	  behavior is
	  to use the format mode from the Image class instead of the
	  Texture class
	  within the subload implementation, and then the size is
	  calculated
	  correctly."

2006-07-05 21:12  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file

2006-07-05 21:12  robert

	* Fixed typo.

2006-07-05 20:56  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "Changed ">" to ">=" when testing for
	  version 16.1 or later."

2006-07-05 13:44  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "There is code in Image.cpp that calculates
	  the size of a compressed image
	  based on the internal format. There is similar code in the
	  Texture class
	  but it does not account for the ARB types. I modified the Texture
	  class
	  implementation to show a warning when an incomplete internal
	  format is
	  used to calculate the image size."

2006-07-05 13:31  robert

	* Added mutex to the test context.

2006-07-05 13:18  robert

2006-07-05 08:59  robert

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "Mingws gcc includes a file called
	  types.h which in turn defines
	  _TYPES_H_. types.h in the directx plugin defines the same include
	  guard. I've renamed the guard name in this file to _DX_TYPES_H_.
	  Now
	  the plugin compile in mingw too."

2006-07-05 08:55  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, renaned FLT_preserveFace to preserveFace

2006-07-04 19:58  robert

	* Changed parameter name from osberver_ptr to observer.

2006-07-04 19:54  robert

	* From Paul Martz,
	  
	  "Previously, the new OpenFlight plugin only allowed ext ref
	  models to use
	  their own palettes. With this change, parent models can override
	  child model
	  palettes with the parent palettes.
	  
	  These changes are made against very current CVS (just updated
	  about 1/2 hour
	  ago, eliminated conflicts, and retested before this posting).
	  
	  To regurgitate what I did:
	  
	  A new class, ParentPools (public osg::Referenced), is created
	  when an ext
	  ref record is parsed, and it is populated with any parent model
	  pools that
	  should override the child model pools (according to bits in the
	  ext ref
	  record). The ParentPools object is then set as UserData on the
	  ProxyNode
	  corresponding to the ext ref.
	  
	  When the ReadExternalsVisitor hits the ProxyNode, it takes its
	  UserData and
	  sets it as UserData in the Options parameter to the
	  osgDB::ReadNode call,
	  which then read the ext ref model. In the course of parsing the
	  Options
	  string, ReaderWriterFLT also looks at the Options UserData and
	  sets the
	  parent pools in the Document class accordingly.
	  
	  When palette records are encountered while loading a file, they
	  are ignored
	  if the corresponding pool was set by the parent.
	  
	  Thanks to Brede for consulting with me on the implementation.
	  "

2006-07-04 14:37  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-07-04 14:18  robert

	* From Stephan Huber,
	  
	  "attached you'll find some modifications to Producer, osgGA and
	  osgProducer to enable Mac OS X support for
	  
	  + scrollwheels,
	  + mightymouse-srollballs
	  + new tracking-pads with scroll feature
	  + tablet-support (pressure, proximity and pointertype) (Wacom
	  only tested)
	  
	  I think there was a bug in the windows-implementation of
	  scroll-wheel
	  support (wrong order of ScrollingMotion-enum, casting problem)
	  which is
	  fixed now.
	  
	  The scrollwheel-code is a bit klunky across platforms, some
	  devices on
	  OS X can report an absolute delta in pixel-coordinates not only
	  the
	  direction, so for now there is scrollingMotion (which describes
	  the
	  direction) and scrolldeltax and scrolldeltay. I decided to leave
	  the
	  scrollingmotion-stuff to not break old code relying on this."

2006-07-04 13:56  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-07-04 13:56  robert

	* Change osgText so that the Text drawable now can have its own
	  StateSet
	  that users can assign to it without it being overriden. If none
	  is
	  assigned externally it now uses a StateSet associated wit the
	  Font assigned
	  to the Text.

2006-07-04 13:33  robert

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  
	  "The attached file corrects two small typos in MultiSwitch.cpp.
	  The
	  local "values" reference and the "_values" member attribute are
	  of
	  different types but both are vectors so the size() operator
	  happily
	  compiles. A renaming of _values to _masks or similar may be a
	  more
	  future proof solution but the submission only removes the
	  underscore
	  in two places.
	  
	  The switch_1701.flt model part of the Creator gallery revealed
	  this bug."

2006-07-04 12:57  robert

	  functions.
	  This is useful for storing compressed textures on disk for rapid
	  playback
	  for animations."

	* From Eric Wing, added support for outline/shadow and colour
	  gradient effects.

2006-06-27 10:07  robert

	* From Terrex and Andrew Sampsom and Don Tidrow and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  email comments from Andew Sampson,
	  
	  "I've contacted Terrex, and obtained the 2.2 version
	  of their trpage library. The library included a
	  fork of OSG 0.9.8's txp plugin, modified to load 2.1+
	  txp DBs.
	  
	  I've done the work of incorporating the changes made
	  to OSG's txp plugin since 0.9.8 into Terrex's fork.
	  The forked version is now up-to-date with the changes
	  made to OSG 0.9.9 and 1.0.
	  
	  Terrex made a lot of changes (especially differences
	  in whitespace), so the diff between the forked version
	  
	  and OSG 1.0's txp plugin is yucky. I did my best, but
	  
	  keep in mind that this is the result of a 4-way merge
	  (kinda... terrex-0.9.8, stock-0.9.8, stock-0.9.9,
	  stock-1.0).
	  
	  I really want to see this forked version merged back
	  into the main OSG branch. The new features offered by
	  
	  this version of the plugin (2.1+ support, variable
	  LOD support, bug fixes) are worth the trouble."
	  
	  --
	  
	  Don Tidrow then took this code and added his work.
	  
	  --
	  
	  Robert Osfield then fixed all the warnings that abound in the
	  trpage code base.

2006-06-26 20:45  robert

	* Replaced ref_ptr<>:take with ref_ptr<>:release, and added
	  handling of removeal
	  of ref_ptr<> operator >.

2006-06-26 20:43  robert

	* Added DeleteHandler flush call.

2006-06-26 20:41  robert

	* From Tyge Løvset, ref_ptr<> template constructor, operators and
	  associated functions.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaks and fixes to the above, also removed
	  the deprecated take() method.

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, fix for Windows

2006-06-26 09:56  robert

	* From Leandro Motta Barros, documentation additions to
	  PrimitiveSet & TriangleFunctor.

2006-06-26 09:30  robert

	* From Philipp Siemoleit,
	  
	  There are some group codes (i.e. "62") which are interpreted as
	  dxfDataType::SHORT. That's right because the dxf-specification
	  defines
	  "16 bit integer" as the type for the corresponding value.
	  But readerBase::readGroup() calls readValue(std::ifstream&,
	  unsigned
	  short). I changed readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) to
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, short). I found no group code at the
	  dxf-specs
	  which needs a "16 bit unsigned integer" value. So the
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) function is obsolete -
	  right?

2006-06-26 09:18  robert

	* From David Fries, Reset only the RenderLeaf objects used in the
	  last
	  frame as given by the _currentReuseRenderLeafIndex instead of

	  From Robert Osfield, made trim method a virtual method of the
	  base Array class
	  and added a trim implementation to TemplateIndexArray.

	* From Joan Abadie: patch fixes : "osgDB::makeDirectory doesn't
	  work on win32 when using full path name like : "d:/demo"
	  it tryes a mkdir("d:")."

2006-06-08 11:19  robert

	* Added setting of default colour.

2006-06-08 11:18  robert

	  ensure backwards compatibility.

2006-05-16 10:21  robert

	* Compile fixes for OSX

2006-05-15 15:46  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, support GLSL uniform arrays. A couple of
	  tweaks and fixes from Robert Osfield.

2006-05-15 13:22  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change is based on current CVS. (Note both
	  Brede and I have submitted
	  changes to this plugin that aren't in current CVS yet -- this
	  change is
	  based on current CVS, not our changed files.)
	  
	  This changes how shader palette records are parsed to support
	  GLSL per the
	  OpenFlight 16.1 spec. Existing functionality for 16.0 files is
	  preserved.
	  
	  The change to Document.h simply adds an enum for VERSION_16_1."

	* From Daniel Trastenjak, added checking of binding modes to ensure
	  that changes are only applied
	  when the binding mode changes, thereby avoiding uncessary calls
	  to dirtyDisplayList.
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, moved bodies of set*Binding() into
	  Geometry.cpp to avoid
	  clutter in the header.

2006-05-15 11:38  robert

	* From Adrian Egli, added std::ifstream::binary qualifier to
	  ifstream usage.

2006-05-15 11:27  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "add support for the v16.0 "Add" texture
	  environment and "mirrored repeat" wrap mode."

2006-05-15 11:22  robert

	* Changed instances of setCoord(const Vec3) to setCoord(const
	  Vec3&) style.

2006-05-15 11:18  robert

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  "- Replaced some member attributes with local variables in Face
	  record.
	  - Multitexture support in Vertex class.
	  - Renamed VertexList to VertexListRecord (VertexList is now a
	  Vertex array)
	  - new Mesh (with reserved field at offset 12, thanks to Paul
	  Martz)
	  - new LocalVertexPool
	  - new MeshPrimitive
	  - Use ProxyNode for externals.
	  - Local cache for externals"

	  BSP loader to OSG by Carlos García.
	  
	  Added Quake3 BSP plugin.

2006-05-09 09:47  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The drawInner() method of
	  osgUtil::RenderStage ignores the
	  checkForGLErrors flag of the osg::State object. The attatched
	  file
	  fixes this."

2006-05-09 09:42  robert

	* From Tree, build fixes for JavaOSG build.

2006-05-09 09:35  robert

2006-05-09 09:12  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The setScale(Vec3) method of
	  osg::AutoTransform does not dirty the
	  matrix. The fix is attached."

2006-05-04 19:39  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-05-04 19:36  robert

2006-05-02 15:52  robert

	* Added selective support for thread safe ref/unref such that the
	  rendering
	  backend now doesn't use thread safe ref counting where
	  multi-buffering exists.
	  This reduces the overhead of multi-threading.

2006-05-02 09:50  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-05-02 09:49  robert

	* Fixed docs on GL_SCALE_NORMAL

2006-05-02 09:45  robert

	* Reorganised the Group::removeChild and Geode::removeDrawable
	  methods so
	  that removeChild(Node*), removeChild(uint) and equivilant Geode
	  methods are
	  now inline methods, not designed to be overriden, and seperated
	  out the
	  multiple remove method to be called removeChildren(uint, uint)
	  which is
	  now the only virtual method. There removeChildren is now the
	  method to
	  override in subclasses.
	  
	  This reorganisation requires some call code to be rename
	  removeChild usage
	  to removeChildren.

2006-05-02 09:18  robert

	* Fixed popping of state frustum.

2006-03-17 22:25  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-03-17 22:23  robert

	* Added exports.

2006-03-17 22:22  robert

	* From Keith Steffen, changed instance of sun to sun_geode to avoid
	  Solaris10 build issue with it defining "sun"?#!

2006-03-17 14:05  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added ability to read/write the texture
	  tile
	  settings of osgParticle::Particle to .osg files.

2006-03-17 11:28  robert

	* From Sohey Yamamoto, fixed eroneous CHECK_BLACK_LISTED_MODES enum
	  value, changing 0xA0 to 0x100

2006-03-15 15:49  robert

	* Added createEvent() convinience method.

2006-03-15 12:26  robert

	* Added comment on the meaning of the matrix paramter in the

2006-03-14 09:23  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, added normals VS project

2006-03-13 21:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The following patch adds a multisample
	  option to the
	  osg::DisplaySettings class. OsgCameraGroup will now read the
	  setting
	  from the DisplaySettings instead of hardcoding the value. I added
	  the
	  following commandline option to be able to set the multisample
	  value:
	  
	  --samples <num>
	  
	  One thing to note, OsgCameraGroup would previously check if the
	  computer is an SGI and set multisample to 4. I retained this
	  check in
	  DisplaySettings to be backwards compatible."

2006-03-13 21:20  robert

	* From Andrew Sampson, "The terravista terrain generation tool can
	  insert references to external model files into a terrapage tile.
	  It unfortunately does not update the bounding sphere of that tile
	  to include the extents of the external model. This means that if
	  a large model (such as an airfield model) is attached to a tile,
	  the model will disappear when the tile is off-screen (outside the
	  view volume), even though the model is on-screen."

2006-03-13 13:19  robert

	* Added an EventQueue directly into osgProducer::Viewer.

2006-03-09 15:16  robert

	* Checked in the genwrapper generated Export.cpp. This does seem to
	  be an eroneously
	  built file though since Export.cpp doesn't appear in the other
	  plugins... I have checked
	  it in here to keep the builds running, there isn't actually any
	  useful body in the Export.cpp.

2006-03-09 13:02  robert

	* Ran dos2unix on new OpenFlight files.

2006-03-08 21:38  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, new OpenFlight plugin!!!!!
	  
	  By default the original flt plugin is still used, to select at
	  runtime
	  the new plugin set the env OSG_OPEN_FLIGHT_PLUGIN=new

2006-03-08 16:11  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, added osg::getGlVersion() and fixed a minor typo
	  in Texture3D.

2006-03-08 15:40  robert

	* Added EventQueue.

2006-03-08 15:30  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "A while back the behaviour of extension
	  alias' was modified so that
	  the user can override existing alias'. The change allowed for
	  circular
	  references, so the createLibraryNameForExtension would get caught
	  in
	  an endless loop. The following fix will catch circular
	  references."

2006-03-08 15:26  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that sometimes when a particle
	  emitter is re-enabled, a few
	  particles will appear at the location it was disabled at. The
	  problem
	  is that the previous local to world matrix is not being updated
	  while
	  it is disabled. I modified the particle processor so that it will
	  set
	  the dirty flag for the previous local to world matrix when the
	  processor is skipped for a frame, since the value will no longer
	  be
	  relevant."

2006-03-08 15:16  robert

	* From Roger James, "1. Fixed a problem with the caching of
	  textures when the associated image file was not in the current
	  working directory. In this case the texture object was being
	  placed in the cache with the short filename, but was looked up
	  with the full path.
	  
	  2. Fixed a problem with the caching of textures when CACHE_IMAGES
	  was enabled. This caused a conflict is the names used to cache
	  the image and texture objects.
	  
	  3. Fixed a problem where AC3D generates surfaces with duplicate
	  vertex indices.
	  
	  4. Removed what I believe are redundant calls to the tesselator.
	  
	  5. Added a couple of asserts which should fire in debug mode if
	  my assumptions about 4. are incorrect.
	  
	  6. Removed obviously unused code. (Stuff that was commented or
	  ifdeffed out.)"
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, changed the asserts to if () report
	  error using notify so we can catch errors in both optimized and
	  debug builds, but without crashing.

2006-03-08 14:09  robert

	* Converted osgGA::GUIEventAdapter into a concrete class capable of
	  respresenting
	  keyboard and mouse events.
	  
	  Added osgGA::EventQueue class to support a thread safe event
	  queue and adaption
	  of keyboard and mouse events.
	  
	  Removed osgProducer::EventAdapter as GUIEventAdapter replaces it.
	  
	  Adapted osgProducer and examples to work with the new changes to
	  osgGA.

2006-03-07 18:26  don

	* Improved the GET protocol for the http socket. By adding
	  Connection: close
	  the server sends a EOF immediately after the data, improving
	  performance
	  because readers are not left waiting for EOF.

2006-03-05 20:46  robert

	* Began work on making EventVisitor capable of adapting events
	  directly.

2006-03-02 20:39  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, support for writing to istream for the the
	  TIFF plugin and support for
	  controlling PNG compression level via the the
	  ReaderWriter::Option string "PNG_COMPRESSION <level>"

2006-03-02 20:31  robert

	* Added automatic toggling between png and jpeg when
	  compressImageData option is used. Jpeg
	  is used to compress RGB data only, the just of the formats are
	  passed on to the png plugin.

2006-03-02 15:26  robert

	* From Robert Swain, compile fix for debian unstable.

2006-03-02 14:58  robert

	* From Farshid Lashakari, support for png write.

2006-03-01 10:17  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached another modified version of
	  the IVE loader which
	  supports compressing the image data. The option to compress the
	  data
	  is "compressImageData". Currently it uses the jpeg plugin to
	  write the
	  image. Maybe we could add an option that allows the user to
	  specify
	  which image format to use. The jpeg writer supports specifying
	  the
	  quality of the jpeg, so you could use the following command line
	  to
	  convert the skydome.osg model to IVE using 50% jpeg quality:
	  
	  osgconv -O "compressImageData JPEG_QUALITY 50" skydome.osg
	  skydome.ive"

2006-02-28 21:18  robert

	* Added TextureRectangle.cpp

2006-02-28 20:10  robert

	* Compile fix.

2006-02-28 19:46  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, added missing array handling into
	  Geometry::accept(AttributeFunctor&
	  af) and Geometry::accept(ConstAttributeFunctor& af).

2006-02-28 19:36  robert

	* Further clean up of RefNodePath references.

2006-02-28 19:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-28 18:54  robert

	* Fixes to removed dependency on RefNodePath.

2006-02-27 19:51  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-27 19:49  robert

	* Ported NodeTrackCallback and NodeTrackManipulator across to use
	  oberserver_ptr
	  instead of RefNodePath.
	  
	  Removed now redundent RefNodePath.

2006-02-27 19:48  robert

	* Added support in osg::computeWorldToLocal and compteLocalToWorld
	  functions for automatically
	  stripping any absolute or root CameraNode's from the NodePaths.
	  
	  Added osg::Node::getWorldMatrices() convinience method.

2006-02-27 19:44  robert

	* Added new observer_ptr templated smart pointer to allow one to
	  retain pointers
	  to objects but have the pointer reset to null if that object is
	  deleted.

2006-02-26 17:45  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've made some changes to the IVE loader
	  which will add the capability
	  of saving image files inside the IVE file. Currently, only the
	  raw
	  image data is saved into the file. If your model uses jpg images
	  as
	  textures then this will cause your file size to increase.
	  
	  I've added an option that will embed the original image file into
	  the
	  IVE file. The IVE file will then attempt to read the image from
	  memory. Since most image loaders support reading from memory,
	  this
	  shouldn't be a problem. To use this new feature the user must
	  specify
	  the option "includeImageFileInIVEFile" when converting to IVE.
	  
	  I tested this out on the "skydome.osg" model that comes with OSG.
	  Using the old method, the IVE file size would be 785 KB, with the
	  new
	  method it is only 42 KB.
	  
	  Also, I've added the support for TextureRectangle's to the IVE
	  reader/writer."

2006-02-24 13:57  robert

	* Added debugging code to help pick out instablilities in
	  osgParticle. Debugging
	  code now commented out.

2006-02-24 13:56  robert

	* Added clamping of the wind force contribution to acceletion of
	  particle so
	  that the de-acceleration never exceed the actual wind vector
	  itself.

2006-02-23 20:37  robert

	* Completed .osg support for ClusterCullingCallback.

2006-02-23 16:47  robert

	* Disabled the running of tristripping and smoothing from within
	  the Simplifier.

2006-02-23 12:41  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

2006-02-23 12:39  robert

	* Fixed function name call.

2006-02-22 20:51  robert

	* Fixed getBound() comment.

2006-02-22 19:28  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-22 19:14  robert

	* Fixed typo of Validity.

2006-02-22 16:05  robert

	* From Thom Carlo, with tweak from Robert Osfield, removed the
	  setting of the outline colour
	  (the emission part of material) during setup of the Carton
	  effects for the second pass.

2006-02-22 14:35  robert

	* Fixed documentation.

2006-02-22 14:31  robert

	* Added support for OpenGL mode black listing to provide better
	  support
	  for extension checking and invalidation of OpenGL modes
	  associated with
	  extensions.

2006-02-21 21:29  robert

	* Added ClusterCullingCallback.cpp

2006-02-21 21:28  robert

	* Added initial cut of ClusterCullingCallback .osg support.

2006-02-21 14:34  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

2006-02-21 13:55  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, VS2005 Syntax highling regonition.

2006-02-21 13:51  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "I've attempted to make AutoTransform override
	  computeBounds() to return
	  an invalid bounding sphere if it hasn't seen a cull traversal
	  yet. It
	  depends on _firstTimeToSetEyePoint, which is initially true, then
	  false
	  after a cull. There might be a better way? If so, let me know.
	  
	  This change does resolve the issue I had encountered with auto
	  scale to
	  screen and incorrect culling."

2006-02-21 12:39  robert

	* From Trajce Nikolov, "small fix for the flt loader - the back
	  color of the bidirectional light points"

2006-02-20 21:05  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, spelling corrections and a few Doxgen
	  comments.

2006-02-20 20:06  robert

	* From Edmond Gheury, fixe and bug in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor.

2006-02-04 21:20  robert

	* From Marco Jez, " I've modified in order to make FBO mipmapping
	  work. In
	  FrameBufferObject.cpp there is also another fix: when
	  initializing a FBO
	  attachment from a CameraNode attachment, the renderbuffer's
	  format must be
	  set to the attachment's internal format, not to the image's pixel
	  format.
	  
	  Another problem is that attaching a renderbuffer to the FBO
	  through
	  CameraNode is not simple (if not impossible) if you don't intend
	  to specify
	  an Image object. Probably CameraNode could be enriched with an
	  "attach(buffer, width, height, format)" method. For example if
	  you attach a
	  color buffer as a texture whose size is different than that of
	  the
	  CameraNode's viewport you also need to attach a depth buffer of
	  the same
	  size, because the depth buffer that is automatically attached by
	  RenderStage
	  has the viewport's size. FBOs require that all attachment have
	  the same
	  dimensions, so said setup will fail if you can't specify a custom
	  depth
	  renderbuffer"

2006-02-04 21:12  robert

2006-01-18 12:13  robert

	* From Marco Jez:
	  
	  here is a patch that enables a new option named
	  "BIND_TEXTURE_MAP" in the LWO plugin. Its purpose is to allow
	  explicit binding between texture UV maps defined in the LWO file
	  and OpenGL texture units, overriding the default mechanism that
	  allocates texture units automatically. This is useful when you
	  have an UV map built in Lightwave (for example an atlas map) but
	  no textures actually using it, so you can keep the UV map (that
	  would be discarded otherwise) and add a texture later int your
	  program.
	  
	  Syntax is:
	  BIND_TEXTURE_MAP <map_name> <texunit>

	  globally.

2005-11-19 12:18  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog, osgversion and AUTHORS file.

2005-11-18 17:04  robert

	* Added the ability for osgParticle::ParticleEffect to switch off
	  the automatic setup.
	  Normally the automatic setup is useful, but in the case of the
	  .osg support this automatic
	  update was forcing premature loading of imagery that wasn't
	  necessarily, and can lead to
	  reports of looking for files that arn't present.

2005-11-18 15:00  robert

	* Added s/getCenter and s/getRotation methods, and updated wrapper.

2005-11-18 14:49  robert

	* From Toshiyuki Takeahei, addition of s/getDistance() methods

2005-11-18 14:46  robert

	* The OpenFlight plugin was crashing with pre 15.6 .flt files that
	  contained
	  light points. This was due to the mismatch is size and fiels in
	  the LightPointRecord
	  before 15.6 and after it, the OSG's flt plugin was assuming just
	  15.6 record
	  structure. As a temporary solution I have disabled the processing
	  of light point
	  records on .flt file version before 15.6, this allows these files
	  to be loaded
	  safely, but without light points.

2005-11-18 10:03  robert

	* From Andrew Reyonolds : changed the endian conversion code to
	  work on a temporary
	  rather then on a flt structure to prevent repeated conversion of
	  the same value,
	  something that led to eroneously large light point string sizes.

2005-11-18 09:52  robert

	* From Rodger James, changed the Win32 static library compilation
	  support to use
	  OSG_LIBRARY_STATIC to avoid problems with building libs when not
	  required.

2005-11-17 20:22  robert

	* Replaced tabs with spaces in examples.

	  special characters.
	  From Robert Osfield, added #if _MSC_VER to restrict pragma usage
	  to just VisualStudio,
	  and added comment explaining all the extra parsing code in
	  osgversion.

2005-11-17 15:03  robert

	* Replaced tabs with spaces.

2005-11-17 13:35  robert

2005-11-17 11:22  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, "fix for another one of those GLSL syntax
	  errors that slip thru the nvidia compiler.
	  gl_TexCoord[] is an array of vec4, and must be reduced to a vec2
	  for use with texture2D()"

2005-11-17 11:13  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, for Cygwin and Minw sections changed
	  definition of INST_SHARE
	  so that it is based on INST_LOCATION, providing the same default
	  as before but
	  also allow it to be override by env vars when required.

2005-11-17 11:09  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, made spacing more consistent.

2005-11-17 11:03  robert

	  osgGA::*Manipulators,
	  change of ' ' to GUIEventAdapter::KEY_Space, fix to url in
	  Matrix_implementation.cpp.
	  Syntax fixes by Robert Osfield to above submission fix

	  Updated the ViewEventHandler
	  so the it now uses the getMatrixManipulatorWithIndex() method to
	  avoid previous ambiguity.

2005-11-14 09:31  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari : "I reported earlier about a problem with
	  a custom emitter I was using.
	  I spent some more time debugging and it turns out there was a bug
	  in
	  the ParticleSystem::update_bounds function. When the bound is
	  being
	  reset, both the min and max are being set to the same postion
	  without
	  the radius being subtracted/added to it. When there is only one
	  particle alive in the system this causes it to be culled by small
	  feature culling. I've modifed the function so that when the bound
	  is
	  reset, the radius is subtracted/added to the position. This fixes
	  my
	  problem."

2005-11-12 21:29  robert

	  axis and rotation rate
	  paramters in its constructor to allow it to be used to create
	  rotations around a point.
	  This provides the same interface and functionality as
	  osgUtil::TransformCallback but
	  has the advantage and AnimationPathCallback is fully supported by
	  the .osg and .ive file formats.

2005-11-09 13:39  robert

	  TextureRectangle. The
	  new SourceFormat and SourceType parameters are only used when no
	  osg::Image is assigned to
	  an osg::Texture, and main use is for render to texture effects.
	  
	  Added support for --hdr option in osgprerender, which utilises
	  the new Texture::setSourceFormat/Type() methods.

2005-11-08 14:03  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2005-11-08 13:51  robert

	  plugin.

2005-11-08 11:46  robert

	* Added sorting and clearing of pre and post RenderStages stored in
	  RenderStage,
	  and added some debugging comments which are currently commented
	  out from compilation -
	  these are left in just in case future debug work requires them.

2005-11-08 09:36  robert

	* Changed the occluder traversal so that checks the children of the
	  SceneView's Cameara
	  rather than starting at the camera itself.

2005-11-07 16:52  robert

	* Renamed VisualStudio.dsw to OpenSceneGraph.dsw

2005-11-07 16:48  robert

	  selectCameraManipulator
	  to force the new minpulator to update correctly.

2005-11-07 14:42  robert

	* From David Spilling, added "noRotation" ReaderWriter::Option into
	  the .obj plugin
	  to enable disabling of the automatic rotation from Y up
	  coordinate frame to Z up coordinate frame.

2005-11-07 13:54  robert

	* From Marco Jez, Added an unregister of the
	  GraphicsContextImplement on unload.

2005-11-07 12:41  robert

	* From David Spilling, fix for typo of OVERRIDE.

2005-11-07 11:14  robert

	* From Gideon May, compile fixes for OSX.

2005-11-07 11:09  robert

	* From Norman Vine, "Cygwin uses unix style path separators"

2005-11-07 11:05  robert

	* From Wang Lam,"The changes allow users of OpenSceneGraph to call
	  a new function
	  readFontStream() to load fonts from a std::istream, rather than
	  from the
	  local filesystem by name. Such a call may be used, for example,
	  if the
	  user has a font fetched over a network, or a font available in
	  memory
	  without a correspondng filename.
	  
	  The changes implement the new function by following the
	  corresponding code
	  for readFontFile(). readFontStream() reads a stream into memory,
	  and
	  holds that memory for FreeType.
	  
	  As a basic test, I mangled the osgtext example to use
	  readFontStream(std::ifstream("font")) in lieu of a readFontFile
	  call, and
	  the modified example ran completely."

2005-11-07 10:29  robert

	* From Ruben (with a few addition/changes from Robert), fixed the
	  commandline of the osgsimplifier example. It now reads
	  --ratio and --max-error.
	  
	  ---------------------------------------------------

2005-11-02 15:56  robert

	* From Brede Johnasen, changed wrap mode to CLAMP_TO_EDGE to avoid
	  edges being
	  seen when zoomed into the reflectio map.

2005-11-02 15:23  robert

	* Added handling of CameraNode into PickVisitor in
	  src/osgProducer/Viewer.cpp. This
	  is unlikely to be the final solution, but does at least fix part
	  of the problem of handling
	  picking HUD's underneath CameraNodes.

2005-11-02 14:24  robert

	* From Marco Jez, added Image/ path to image files to help find
	  them from the OpenSceneGraph-Data directory.

	  bottom left of window to accomdate a greater range of display
	  sizes.
	  From Robert Osfield, made the background colour of the intersted
	  camera a scaled down verson of the main background colour to make
	  it more obvious.

2005-11-02 12:22  robert

	* Added a setSupportsDisplayList(false) to constructor to prevent
	  end users
	  enabling display lists, something that can break the osgText's
	  managment
	  of state.

2005-11-02 11:55  robert

	* Fixed setCameraRequiresSetUp so it properly uses the bool passed
	  to it.

2005-11-02 11:33  robert

	* Added doc comment and removed redundent inline keyword

2005-11-02 10:57  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I need the ability to check for a font
	  file without actually loading
	  the font object. I've modified font.h/cpp of osgText so that it
	  exports the findFontFile function."

2005-11-02 10:55  robert

	* From Marco Jez, commented out debuggin message.

2005-11-02 10:49  robert

	* Added usage of image copy and modification.

2005-11-01 15:39  robert

	* Set the draw and read buffer to GL_NONE when using FBO's, thereby
	  avoid
	  invalid enumrates being generated.

2005-11-01 15:23  robert

	* Improved handling of osg::Image copying.

2005-11-01 11:18  robert

	* From Brad Colbert, Added checking for a NULL return string rom
	  gluErrorString (with slight reformating of this by Robert
	  Osfield.)

2005-11-01 11:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added RenderTargetFallback option into osg::CameraNode.

2005-10-31 16:40  robert

	* From Steve Lunsford, "Attached is a copy of TXPNode.cpp with the
	  repaired computeBounds call. I
	  discovered that TXPNodes were being culled out prematurely
	  because the
	  loaded sub-tiles resulted in a computed bounds that was smaller
	  than the
	  extents indicated in the archive. I think this fix should be
	  fine. I can't
	  think of any reason why we would want to use anything other than
	  the archive
	  extents."

2005-10-31 14:48  robert

	* Added default setting of _threading_model to ThreadPerCamera when
	  multiple cameras
	  are present, and SingleThreaded when a single camera is being
	  used.

2005-10-31 11:43  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "some tweaks to the osgSim lightpoints.
	  
	  - The first change is to start fadeing a lightpoint just before
	  the
	  maximum distance of a light is reached.
	  - The second change is to start fading a lightpoint when
	  pixelSize is
	  less than _minPixelSize instead of 1.0."

2005-10-29 11:29  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-29 10:04  robert

	* Added catch for NULL return from glGetString( GL_VERSION );

2005-10-29 09:52  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-28 18:39  robert

	* From Marco Jez, Fix for the class name lookup in
	  osgDB::Registry::writeObject(), which can silently fail when a
	  NodeKit's class (for example osgNVCg::Program) has the same name
	  as that of an OSG's class (for example osg::Program).

2005-10-28 18:37  robert

	* Fixed env var docs for sharing graphics contexts.

2005-10-28 14:02  robert

	* Added warning message for when no file is loaded.

2005-10-28 13:18  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, "Here is an update to BlendEquation that adds
	  checking for the
	  SGIX_blend_alpha_minmax and EXT_blend_logic_op extensions. It is
	  tested with the osgblendequation example. If the extensions are
	  not
	  supported, a WARN level notification is generated."

2005-10-28 13:11  robert

	* Moved SceneView across to use an osg::CameraNode to store the
	  projection and view matrices,
	  the viewport, the clear colour and the subgraph needing rendered.
	  This is done
	  transparently so all existing functionality will behave as
	  before. What it does
	  add is the ability to set a SceneView directly by a single
	  osg::CameraNode when required.

2005-10-28 10:33  robert

	* Changed debug message from NOTICE to INFO level of notification

2005-10-28 10:11  robert

	* Added documentation line about 32 being the maximum permitted
	  number of line segmenets

2005-10-27 11:11  robert

	* Added error message to report when too many line segments are
	  added to an IntersectVisitor.

2005-10-27 10:48  robert

	* Added support for tracking the directory of the output file
	  whilst still maintaining
	  local file references within this directory.

2005-10-27 09:38  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, "New functionality is the ability to
	  automatically determine the
	  maximum traversal depth necessary to obtain an accurate estimate
	  of
	  the minimum number of required cameras. In addition, the user can
	  specify an absolute maximum traversal depth that will not be
	  exceeded."

2005-10-27 09:37  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, update to osgdelaunday.

2005-10-26 20:30  robert

	* Added friend declarations of nested classes to prevent compile
	  problems under VS6.0

2005-10-26 20:00  robert

	* Changed the minimum tile image size to be 4x4 to avoid problems
	  in mipmap generation
	  that was occuring at sizes of 2x2, seemingly somewhere in the
	  OpenGL driver.

2005-10-26 16:02  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "changed two set methods
	  (setFocalLength,setFieldOfView) to perform
	  assignment."

2005-10-25 15:43  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari & Robert Osfield: Added support for
	  VERTICAL_INTERLACE and HORIZONTAL_INTERLACE
	  stereo modes use the stencil buffer.

	  ERROR_IN_READING_FILE and
	  FILE_NOT_FOUND cases.

2005-10-25 09:49  robert

	* Added protected destructors.

2005-10-25 09:43  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, removed unncessary includes.

2005-10-25 09:23  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, changed osg_InverseViewMatrix to
	  osg_ViewMatrixInverse to bring
	  into line with OpenGL shader languague conventions.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed the SceneView::ActiveUnforms enum to
	  from INVERSE_VIEW_MATRIX_UNIFORM
	  VIEW_MATRIX_INVERSE_UNIFORM to be convistent with the above
	  change.

2005-10-24 18:51  robert

	  and help display"

2005-10-24 11:44  robert

	* From Marco Jez, added missing example project files.

2005-10-24 11:37  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin:
	  
	  "This is a small fix for flt2osg.[cpp|h] that handles
	  old style road segments ( from Multigen II w/road
	  tools on IRIX ) in the same way as the newer road
	  constructions. ie create a group and do a nested
	  traversal.
	  
	  This makes roads appear in older format files where
	  there was previously a gap. This actually works
	  properly with the paths which are marked as hidden in
	  the openflight database."

2005-10-24 11:34  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, "I discovered that externally-referenced models
	  in the TXP format didn't
	  get positioned correctly when the TXP database was built using
	  the
	  'tile-offset' mode. I've included a tarball with what I believe
	  are the
	  needed changes - they work for the sample databases I have
	  available,
	  but not all conditions have been tested. I've set things up such
	  that
	  these changes shouldn't affect 'normal' txp databases."

2005-10-24 11:25  robert

	* Warning fixes for Win32 build.

2005-10-24 10:53  robert

	* Added copyright notices.

	* Renamed osgUtil::RenderGraph to osgUtil::StateGraph

2005-10-13 10:29  robert

	* Changed the "Cessna" text so that it is sized according to
	  OBJECT_COORDS rather
	  than SCREEN_COORDS as the later was causing problems with the
	  pixel size based LOD selection.

2005-10-13 08:18  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-13 08:07  robert

	* Added Producer.lib to osgdepthpartion project file

2005-10-13 08:05  robert

	* Added PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes make options to the unix build
	  system, not defining
	  PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes or setting it to another value than yes
	  (i.e no) will result
	  in the osgProducer library, OSG applications and demos not being
	  built.
	  
	  PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes is the default.

2005-10-12 18:42  robert

	* Added SmokeTrailEffect which renders created particles as single
	  quad or line
	  strip, in the case of the quad strip the strip is aligned to the
	  be orthogonal with
	  the eye point.

2005-10-11 09:47  robert

	* Added new shell of new class ConnectedParticleSystem, which will
	  be used
	  for managing connect particle system for the purpose of doing
	  missile trails etc.

	  rotation and
	  translations within the reflector nodepath.

2005-10-06 15:43  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, added support for PolygonMode into .ive
	  format.

2005-10-06 15:41  robert

	* Changed the fallback code to use the result form the realize()
	  call, removed
	  the code path from running a PBuffer as a seperate graphics
	  context (this
	  was found to be slower than running single threaded so its not
	  worth the
	  extra complexity).

2005-10-06 13:31  robert

	* Added env var reporting for the OSG_CAMERA_THREADING and
	  OSG_SHARE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXTS env vars.

2005-10-06 13:20  robert

	* Added catch for disabling ThreadPerCamera when contexts are
	  shared.

2005-10-06 11:26  robert

	* Improved the fallback mechanism from FBO, down to PBuffer_RTT
	  down to PBuffer down to frame buffer.

2005-10-05 16:21  robert

	* Moved the testing and setting up of FBO/Pbuffer extension from
	  CullVisitor to
	  support into RenderStage to allow better fallback
	  implementations.

2005-10-05 09:48  robert

	* Added support for CameraView into NodeVistor, and support for
	  CameraNode and CameraView
	  into the AnimationPathCallback so you can now animate both via
	  animation paths.

2005-10-04 18:50  robert

	* Added code paths for PBuffer RTT support.

2005-10-04 13:41  robert

	* Added osg::CameraView to help application/modellers position
	  their cameras in scenes. Note,
	  CameraView is *not* a camera, it isn't an active object, but a
	  passive one that
	  camera must track each frame to following the path of the
	  CameraView.

2005-10-03 19:37  robert

	* From Keith Steffen, fixed bug in StateSet::clear() where parents
	  of texture attributes
	  where not being reset correctly due to incorrect ordering of
	  _textureAttributeList.clear().

2005-10-03 19:33  robert

	* From MFM, Added FreeBSD specific implementation for

	* Adding handling of case of convex azimuth side ways of sphere
	  segment.

2005-09-30 19:36  robert

	* Changed the line intersection algorithm to computer full line
	  intersections then
	  trim down to size by intersecting with the sphere segmenet
	  sufaces

2005-09-29 15:55  robert

	* Fix to intersection code.

	  Fix to the update of the error metrics on the edges in the
	  simplification mesh that are affected by an edge collapse.
	  
	  Addition of 'n' and 'p' keyboard control in osgsimplifier example
	  to allow users to control the sample ratio manually.

2005-09-28 14:18  robert

	* From Marco Jez, "Problems fixed:
	  
	  1. type converters created automatically by the I_BaseType macro
	  use
	  static_cast<> even for base-to-derived conversions.
	  dynamic_cast<> should be
	  used instead.
	  2. as a consequence of the above fix, I_BaseType must now
	  differentiate
	  between polymorphic and non-polymorphic base classes, because the
	  latter
	  can't be dynamic_cast'd to derived classes. Some template magic
	  (see
	  is_polymorphic<> in ReflectionMacros) is used to detect
	  polymorphism at
	  compile time (I'm NOT sure it works on all platforms as it's
	  partly
	  implementation-dependent. Please test!).
	  3. predefined custom property getters/setters/counters/etc. (as
	  those
	  defined for STL containers) only work on Value objects that
	  contain
	  non-pointer instances. This was an unwanted restriction that no
	  longer
	  exists.
	  
	  Wrappers will need to be recompiled. This is a good time to give
	  them a
	  fresh update with genwrapper.
	  
	  NOTE: fix #1 should get rid of those crashes and strange
	  behaviours that
	  some users noticed while using osgIntrospection through osgTcl or
	  in their
	  own code."

2005-09-28 14:05  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "The following files are drop-in replacements
	  for the include/*/Export files to permit
	  building statically linked osg libraries under Win32."

2005-09-28 13:55  robert

	* From Leandro Motta Barros: fixed type of ATTRIBUTE_*

2005-09-28 13:53  robert

	* From A. Botorabi, "slightly modified osgUtil's
	  TangentSpaceGenerator class to allow the
	  option for using or not using geom's indices for tangent space
	  vectors
	  generation. now, Ruben's code is also used (it was disabled
	  before). in
	  order to keep backward compatibility, the compute method behaves
	  as before
	  in default case."

2005-09-28 13:45  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, comments explaining font search rules

2005-09-28 13:39  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, fixes from VS 7.1 build.

2005-09-24 16:11  don

	* Brede's changes for limited morphed vertex support. These changes
	  allow
	  a model with morphed vertecies to load correctly with LOD
	  switches, but
	  does not implement the vertex morphing.

2005-09-24 14:53  robert

	* Improvements to the clipping of polygons at boundary edges.

	  osg::buffer_object and a local struct to store
	  initialized to help with multi-thread and out of order context
	  usage.

2005-09-19 14:07  robert

	* Added support for "-O OutputTextureFiles" options string in .osg
	  plugin to
	  allow texture files to be written out when writing out a .osg
	  file.

2005-09-19 13:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, append "\fonts" to end of windows font
	  search path.

2005-09-11 19:05  robert

	* From Sondra Iverson, "The options to rewind/restart and to toggle
	  looping in the osgmovie
	  example have been implemented. "

2005-09-11 19:02  robert

	* converted hardware tabs to spaces.

2005-09-11 19:00  robert

	  computing
	  the intersection between an indivual geometry and the sphere
	  segment.
	  
	  Converted the terrain in osgspheresegment to be an osg::Geometry
	  based
	  drawable rather than a osg::ShapeDrawable/osg::HeightField one to
	  make it
	  more practicle to use as a test for the new SphereSegment
	  intersection code.

2005-09-08 18:56  robert

	* Added PolytopeVisitor to SphereSegment.cpp to help cull down to
	  only drawables
	  that intersect with the frustum of the SphereSegment.
	  PolytopeVisitor may
	  eventually be pulled out to be more generally used along the
	  lines of osgUtil::IntersectVisitor.

2005-09-08 13:10  robert

	* Added initial interface for computing intersections between
	  sphere segments
	  and terrain.

	  files that only had partial colour palettes
	  
	  Which are typically found in older 14.x files and file converted
	  through Polytrans or Deep exploration etc.
	  
	  The code that grabs the color entries in
	  ConvertFromFLT::visitColorPalette was assuming that there were
	  full
	  palettes always coming in and stepping was out of bounds in
	  certain cases (not all) and thus crashing with
	  access violations etc,
	  
	  Although the normal from Creator is to have 1024 or 512 entries ,
	  this is not a really requirement of the format, just the way
	  Creator creates its default palettes etc.
	  
	  Code changed to look at the number of entries and use just those

	* From Fabio Mierlo,

	  The RAW option store the RGBE values into a Image, to use
	  this option you need to decode the RGBE value in the frag-
	  ment shader. Follow the cube map glsl decoder:
	  
	  vec4 textureCubeRGBE( uniform samplerCube sampler, vec3 coords )
	  {
	  ivec4 rgbe = textureCube( sampler, coords ) * 255. + 0.5;
	  float e = rgbe.a - ( 128 + 8 );
	  return vec4( rgbe.rgb * exp2( e ), 1.0 );
	  }
	  
	  This option is usefull for who have a outdate hardware like
	  FX cards and want to do cool things.
	  
	  Finally this patch is need by a new HDR Rendering example
	  that I will put on the Wiki."

	* From Jeremy Bell,
	  
	  "My patch is a slight refactoring of the mac specific code in
	  Registry.cpp and FileUtils.cpp, specifically around the library
	  and
	  resource file path initilialization methods. This patch cleans up
	  a
	  lot of the mac specific code by moving repeated code into
	  separate
	  local functions in FileUtils.cpp that are only compiled on mac
	  builds.
	  It also adds one function to the API,
	  appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils. This
	  function
	  will mirror the already existing
	  appendPlatformSpecificLibraryFilePaths except for resource file
	  paths.
	  Currently this function is empty except when built on the mac, in
	  which case it will add the application bundle's internal
	  Resources
	  folder and the bundle's parent folder. Previously this code was
	  implemented as a separate mac specific #ifdef block in
	  Registry.cpp
	  around the initDataFilePathList method. However, it now is
	  implemented
	  in appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils.cpp and
	  the
	  initDataFilePathList method is now the same on all platforms.
	  This
	  patch should behave the same as before on non-mac platforms.
	  
	  This patch already includes the fix that Eric mentioned earlier.
	  This
	  patch is based off of the 0.99 release code. I have tested this
	  patch
	  using the following testing scheme:
	  
	  Make a proper bundled application.
	  While Run from the Finder:
	  Test that it finds plugins in its internal plugins path.
	  Test that it finds resources in its internal resources path.
	  Test that it finds resources in the bundle's parent directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the user's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the system's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the Network Application Support
	  Directory
	  Check the plugin and resource path lists after they have been
	  initialized to see if they are in the correct order
	  
	  While Run from the command line (both from it's parent directory
	  and
	  from inside the /Contents/MacOS directory) and repeat the above
	  tests.
	  Check that it also finds plugins and resources within the paths
	  defined by various environment variables.
	  
	  Now, Make an application that is NOT bundled/command line only
	  Test that it does NOT try to look in an internal bundle
	  plugin/resource directory for plugins or resources.
	  Test that it finds plugins/resources in the paths defined by the
	  environment variables.

	  colinear points.

2005-06-24 19:50  robert

	* From Colin McDonald,
	  "On fixing the pointer access I discovered that reading osga
	  archives
	  containing ive files went into a cpu loop. This turned out to be
	  a
	  problem with proxy_streambuf on Solaris. Public methods in the
	  Solaris
	  streambuf standard library implementation rely on the gptr()
	  being set,
	  which proxy_streambuf was not doing. So I have modified
	  proxy_streambuf to set the input sequence pointers, and have also
	  aligned it more with the standard library streambuf
	  implementation
	  where all input is through underflow(), not uflow() which merely
	  calls
	  underflow() and advances the pointer."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, change from using pointer cast and
	  assignment to using
	  a templated _write and _read method to avoid pointer aliasing to
	  2/4/8
	  byte boundaries that some computer system may produce. These
	  changes
	  where inspried by Colin McDonalds change to using memcpy, these
	  changes weren't merged as memcpy is not as clear in naming as
	  _read,
	  _write and memcpy will incurr a function call just for copy a
	  uint.

2005-06-24 15:39  robert

	* From Colin McDonald:
	  
	  "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris:
	  
	  For multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified
	  on both
	  the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to
	  the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT flags in the
	  system
	  header files, and links the -lthread library in the correct
	  order.
	  
	  When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC option should be
	  specified.
	  Although Solaris will handle shared libraries without
	  position-independent code there is a performance penalty. The
	  linker
	  reference manual says: 'If a shared object is built from code
	  that is
	  not position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large
	  number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although the
	  runtime
	  linker is equipped to handle this, the system overhead this
	  creates can
	  cause serious performance degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:34  robert

	* From Martijn Kragtwijk: "I ran into the same problems as Karl
	  Martensson
	  (http://openscenegraph.org/archiver/osg-users/2005-June/0575.html);
	  after switching children of a Switch node off and on again, they
	  become
	  unpickable. This issue occurs first in 0.9.9, with 0.9.8
	  everything is fine.
	  My fix involves calling dirtyBound() every time the on/off-values
	  of the
	  Switch are changed"

2005-06-24 15:30  robert

	* From David Guthrie, "The call NSLookupAndBindSymbol was changed
	  to
	  NSLookupSymbolInModule. The former call would lookup the named
	  symbol NOT in the current dynamic library, but in the entire
	  running
	  program while the call NSLookupSymbolInModule, takes the handle
	  to
	  the library the symbol should be found in. This means the current
	  code will fail if one loads multiple bundles at runtime and
	  attempts
	  to load the same named symbol from each one."

2005-06-24 15:15  robert

	* Moved the working createPagedLODScene() implemention into

2005-06-15 11:49  robert

	* From David Guthrie, " In the constructor
	  in removes any options beginning with "-psn" from argv on OSX by
	  calling the "remove" method. When a .app run is created in OSX,
	  which is required to get a fully functioning UI application, the
	  OSX
	  finder passes a -psn_XXXX option to the application where the
	  XXXX
	  refers to a unique process number. An example option would be "-
	  psn_0_37617665". The argument parser was choking on this option
	  in
	  all the osg example applications."

2005-06-15 10:59  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, "modified .rot pseudoloader plugin so rotation
	  order actually matches the embedded documentation"

2005-06-06 10:18  robert

	* From Mathia Walker: bug fix to LOD ranges in TXP plugin to avoid
	  cracks:
	  
	  "I took a closer look at the conditional code in
	  SeamFinder::seamReplacement().
	  
	  Because _info.minRange is a double and lod->getMinRange(0) is a
	  float,
	  the difference will be calculated with double precision. If
	  _info.minRange is cast as a float it is exactly the same value as
	  lod->getMinRange(0) and the difference is exactly zero.
	  
	  So if you change
	  
	  
	  if((fabs(_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs(_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  to
	  
	  
	  if((fabs((float)_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs((float)_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  it works a lot better."

	* From Adam Richard, fixed typos + explanation how to use project
	  files.

2005-05-31 06:21  robert

	* From Tim Daust, "I fixed the getScale functions in matrixf and
	  matrixd. It was returning the values of the diagonal
	  of the matrix, which only returns the scale if there
	  is not a rotation. I fixed this by returning the
	  length of the vectors that form the basis.
	  I also added a function to orthonormalize the
	  rotation component of the matrix. I seem to always run
	  into situations where non uniform (or even uniform)
	  scale complicate my calculations, and I thought other
	  members of the community could use this function as
	  well."

	* From Joson Daly, fix for forward/backward/swing animation
	  handling both 15.8 and
	  versions prior to 15.8, and...
	  
	  " Here's another fix for OpenFlight. The symptom was that ATTR
	  files were
	  not being read correctly, and the TexEnv on a texture that should
	  have
	  been set to DECAL was instead defaulting to MODULATE. The cause
	  is that
	  the ATTR reader cannot tell by itself what version it's reading
	  (the
	  version information isn't present in the ATTR files), and instead
	  relies
	  on the ReaderWriter::Options passed in to get the OpenFlight
	  version.
	  
	  My change clones the current ReaderWriter::Options and prepends
	  the
	  appropriate FLT_VER option before the ReaderWriterATTR object is
	  called. I also made the parsing of the FLT_VER string and value
	  more
	  robust in the ReaderWriterATTR itself. I think I commented things
	  OK,
	  but let me know if you need me to explain anything."

	* From Alberto Farre, nested files bug fix.

2005-04-04 11:18  robert

	* From Alberto Farre:
	  "Here there are fixes for several flt loader problems.
	  
	  First one was an small bug when root database was an empty string
	  we got a database path "/" instead of "./".
	  Second one is more complex. Flt loader works in two passes, first
	  one reads flt database and second one builds osg scenegraph.
	  Special care must be taken for properly tracking database path as
	  nested files are entered. Because textures are loaded in second
	  pass, mentioned care should be taken once again. I wrote time ago
	  a piece of code and I placed it in both files fltFile.cpp and
	  flt2osg.cpp. After a long period offline I have seen the portion
	  of code at flt2osg was missing, I just made some tests and I
	  could see it is still required.
	  
	  Finally, I have seen that pool.cpp always try to make IMAGE cache
	  instead of reading what Options says.
	  
	  Aditonally, I recently wrote an osg change, now it has external
	  references "a la flt" what is called osg::ProxyNode. As part of
	  the change now flt loader builds external references as
	  ProxyNodes. I made the same mistake like pool.cpp and always made
	  ARCHIVE cache instead of see what Options says, it has also been
	  fixed."

	* From Ruben, added handling of vertex indices.
	  
	  Note from Robert. New codes produces errors when running
	  osgfxbrowser cow.osg so I have elected to keep the original
	  implementation of compute_basis_vectors around and as the default
	  compile to keep the CVS version working. Ruben's new version
	  of compute_basis_vectors has to be explicitly compiled in by
	  toggling an #if 1 block to #if 0.

2005-03-07 12:14  robert

	* From Marco Jez, "Current version of the LWO plugin creates one
	  Geode with a single Geometry
	  for each Lighwave surface, in order to keep surface names
	  (geometries can't
	  have names). The attached fix adds a plugin option named
	  "COMBINE_GEODES"
	  that allows to place all geometries under a single Geode whenever
	  possible,
	  thus offering better chances of further optimization through
	  osgUtil::Optimizer. The downside is that surface names are no
	  longer stored
	  in the scene graph when using this option."

	  * Directional lights should now work as in Performer using a
	  viewing
	  frustrum defined by a direction vector, horizontal angular width,
	  vertical
	  angular width, and roll angle about the direction vector. The

	  directional light implementation had some bad assumptions which

2004-05-08 21:33  robert

	* From Paul Martz,

	  override
	  support for external references. This is the last of my code
	  changes to
	  support OF 15.8 in the flt loader. Barring bugs, of course, knock
	  on wood.
	  
	  The gist of the animation palette code is to create ref_ptr'd
	  osgSim::BlinkSequence objects for each palette entry, and then
	  pass them on
	  to osgSim::LightPoint for any OpenFlight light points that
	  reference that
	  palette entry. This should be conservative of memory (not that I
	  expect the
	  animation palette to be extremely large)."

2004-03-06 15:03  robert

	* From Paul Marz : "Input.h, Input.cpp -- Here's where support for
	  reading the continuation
	  record goes. I added a new function to read a continued record
	  body. I added
	  code in the existing ReadRecord routine to peek ahead for a
	  CONTINUATION_OP
	  if the current record could possibly be continued.
	  
	  opcodes.h -- Besides adding the opcode for CONTINUATION_OP, I
	  also added new
	  15.8 opcodes. I labeled opcodes as "ignored" if I could easily
	  discern that
	  our loader wasn't doing anything with them. For historical
	  reasons, I added
	  all obsolete opcodes, prefixed with "OBS_".
	  
	  LocalVertexPoolRecord.h, LocalVertexPoolRecord.cpp -- This is one
	  of three
	  types of records that can be continued with a CONTINUATION_OP
	  record. I
	  removed all invalid assertions that assumed the record length
	  would always
	  be less than 65535. I replaced the "vertex size" calculation with
	  a more
	  efficient method based on caching the size from attribute bits,
	  rather than
	  taking the length of the record and dividing it by numVerts
	  (which would
	  have been incorrect if the record had been continued)."

2004-03-06 14:38  robert

	* From Marco Jez, on behalf of Farshid Lashkari. Details from
	  Marco's email: "I've just received an addition to osgParticle
	  from Farshid Lashkari. It enhances the generation of texture
	  coordinates on particles so that animated textures can be used,
	  with the current frame of animation being computed from each
	  particle's current age.
	  Clients just have to call Particle::setTextureTile() and specify
	  the number of
	  horizontal and vertical tiles that make the animation up in the
	  texture image."

2004-03-04 18:35  robert

	* From Paul Martz/Robert Osfield. Addition of initializers in

2003-11-21 20:21  robert

	* Removed the ScalarBar:: from the from of the
	  ScalarPrinter::printScalar() calls.

2003-11-21 19:33  robert

	* Added support to slideshow3D for -s commandline option allow the
	  size of

	  Matrix internally
	  so will depend on what is set as the default in
	  include/osg/Matrix.

	  value_type. This
	  allows Matrix to be converted to use double's simply by change
	  the definition
	  of value_type. Added Matrix::glLoadlMatrix and

2003-09-02 20:39  robert

	* Merged changed to osgParticle from Marco Jez, the changes are
	  (quoted from
	  email from Marco)
	  
	  "Most relevant news:
	  1) particle systems now have the "freezeOnCull" property set to
	  false by
	  default. Since it is an optimization, and using it may cause some
	  unwanted
	  behaviors if not handled properly, it makes more sense to turn it
	  off by
	  default.
	  2) new "LINE" shape mode which uses GL_LINES to draw line
	  segments that
	  point to the direction of motion.
	  3) particles can now have a rotation angle and angular velocity.
	  4) new AngularAccelOperator applies angular acceleration to
	  particles.
	  5) particle processors such as emitters and programs can have a
	  "start",
	  "end" and "reset" time coordinate. For example, an emitter may be
	  instructed
	  to start emitting particles only after a certain time, stop after
	  another
	  amount of time and then start again.
	  
	  Update (2) is from Gideon May.
	  Updates (3) to (5) are from Douglas A. Pouk."

	  (double).
	  
	  Added osg::Matrixf::glLoadMatrix() and
	  osg::Matrixf::glMultiMatrix() methods
	  and changed corresponding usage of glLoad/MultMatrixf() calls
	  across to use these
	  methods. Again prep for support Matrixd.
	  
	  Fixes for VisualStudio 6.0 compile.

2003-09-02 17:16  robert

	* Converted eroneous writeLong/readInt boolean entries used

	  race condition
	  during parallel makes.

2003-03-13 14:29  robert

	* Reverted Don's changed of sqrtf to sqrt. Don't understand why the
	  change was

	  o Object files now go in subdirectories named $(OS)$(ARCH).Opt
	  and
	  $(OS)$(ARCH).Debug for OS's that support both architectures.
	  eg. Linux32.Opt and Linux32.Debug
	  
	  o Libraries links are now placed in lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. lib/Linux32/
	  
	  o Binaries are now placed in bin/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. bin/Linux32
	  
	  o 'make install' and 'make instlinks' now place files/links in
	  /usr/local/{include,lib,share/OpenSceneGraph} by default on
	  most systems (Solaris still goes in /opt/OpenSceneGraph).
	  Rather than having the somwehat confusing INST_SYS_PREFIX and
	  INST_SHARE_PREFX, you can override these with just
	  INST_LOCATION
	  For example,
	  make INST_LOCATION=/usr
	  will place files at /usr/include, /usr/lib,
	  /usr/share/OpenSceneGraph.

2003-03-12 21:02  robert

	  if so it
	  doesn't do any further drawing.
	  
	  The osgProducer::Viewer has been set up to set the osg::State's
	  it manages
	  with their AbortRendering flag pointers set to the
	  osgProducer::Viewer::_done
	  memeber varaible. Now when escape is pressed the rendering is
	  aborted early.

2003-03-11 13:30  robert

	* Bug fixes to osgText to handle the osgUtil::Optimizer being used
	  on a scene

	  plane, thereby
	  fixing the problems which occur when the above is applied.

	  null's and
	  rec length to determine the length of a string.

2003-03-06 21:35  robert

	* Added maximum width and maximum height limits to the
	  osgText::Text which
	  automatically wraps text which goes beyond these limits.

	* Reverted the changes to ref_ptr<> for implicit cast to pointer.

2003-03-06 17:11  robert

	* Changed the osgText::Font implementation so it used a facade us
	  abstract away
	  the actual implemention. This has been done so that when a
	  freetype font is
	  created the implementation can unloaded when the freetype plugin
	  is unloaded
	  without breaking the main font.
	  
	  Also add image margin around founds to prevent any image
	  boundaries appearing.

2003-03-06 13:45  robert

	* Reverted the ref_ptr<> implementation to prior implicit cast
	  operator via

	* Further improvements to osgText and the freetype plugin, handling
	  different
	  font sizes better and plugin removal safely.

2003-03-04 09:08  robert

	* Renamed "libunfreetype.lib" to "freetype.lib"

2003-03-03 22:47  robert

	* Added examples/osghud - a osgProducer port of the old osghud
	  demo.

2003-03-03 22:18  robert

	* Added osg::Image::AllocationMode enum and associated set/get
	  methods.
	  osg::Image::setImage has also been modified to require the

	  mode to be passed to it so that it knows how to delete the data
	  once the
	  image goes out of scope.
	  
	  Port the image plugins across to specify the new AllocationMode,
	  and converted
	  them across to using new/delete in place of malloc/free.

2003-02-24 12:02  robert

	* Implemented an osg::minimum and osg::maximum template functions
	  to replace
	  the std::min/max functions previously used in parts of the osg,
	  since the
	  std::min/max methods do not seem implemented under IRIX.

	* Ported osgstereoimage to use osgProducer, added it to the
	  examples directory.

	* Added #include<algorithm> to keep OSX build compiling.
	  
	  Reverted the mymax implementation to std::max, hopefully this
	  should be ok now
	  that we have standardised on non native STL under VisualStudio.

	  when ready to delete to minimize the amount of time that a race
	  condition
	  condition can happen.

2003-01-22 20:48  robert

	* Vertex program update from Brede.

	  the objects
	  and realistic, if they arn't then decal texture can produce
	  better results..

2003-01-22 12:06  robert

	* Fixed an Optimizer crash where if the top most node of a model
	  was
	  a static transform it would crash when this root was deleted.
	  Have fixed
	  by recognising this node as one not to remove and set it to
	  identity instead.

2003-01-21 21:02  robert

	* Changed the local header includes from <> to "" to help the OSG

	  values before they
	  are passed on to the OSG.

	  subclasses
	  of Drawable handle their own compile implementation, such as used
	  by text.

2003-01-20 20:33  robert

	* Improvements to osgProducer lib, in particular adding a mutex
	  lock to the init() call in
	  SceneView to prevent init running multi-threaded.

2003-01-20 20:28  robert

	* Improvements to the handling of multiple graphics contexts. Still

	  defines respectively.

2003-01-20 10:41  robert

	* Updates from Pavel.
	  
	  1. Storing color of geometry in ColorArray e.g. its don't work

	  2. Detecting of alpha channel and automatically enabling
	  blending.

2003-01-20 09:56  robert

	* Update the ReaderWriterATTR file so that it used the definitions
	  that Joseph
	  Steel obtained from MPI.
	  
	  Removed the unique child check from the flt::PrimRecord and
	  osg::Group, this
	  allows more flexibility when specifing nodes, and is faster..

2003-01-20 09:09  robert

	* From Ruben, updates to the IV/VRML1 loader to handler large
	  datasets.

2003-01-20 08:58  robert

	  normalized
	  coord system.
	  
	  Addition of ReadCameraConfigFile and WriteCameraConfigFile as a
	  tempory
	  measure for implementing local a C++ read/write of the
	  Producer::CameraConfig, this
	  will be removed once these implementations or similar have been
	  moved to Producer.

2003-01-18 10:17  robert

	* Updated the KeyboardMouseCallback so this it takes into account
	  the the new
	  passiveMouseMotion support in Producer.

2003-01-18 09:44  robert

2003-01-14 14:21  robert

	* Added an compile in option of applying the matrices before state
	  in the RenderLeaf
	  apply method. This order is intended to help support of vertex

	  put all the
	  orignal seperate headers and source into
	  include/osg/UnitTestFrameWork

	  to
	  keep the include and source directories focused on the scene
	  graph rather
	  than the test framework.
	  
	  Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which are
	  optionally
	  compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define, which is only
	  currently defined in debug builds under unix. It should be fine

	  OGL headers.
	  
	  Added float.h to Math's compile path for VS7 compilation.

2002-08-26 12:34  robert

2002-08-22 08:14  robert

	* Fixed the osg::Transform::coompute*() methods so the were using
	  the _referenceFrame
	  correctly, as previously they were doing the exact opposite from
	  what they
	  should have been doing.

2002-08-21 20:42  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "I found a small bug in QTtexture.c: the code
	  fails, when the image-files
	  don't reside on the boot-partition. I replaced the offending

	  cleaner one.".

2002-08-20 22:43  robert

	* Moved the include<osg/GLExtensions> from the State header into
	  State.cpp, and

2002-08-20 10:08  robert

	* A FogCoordinateSource set/get methods to osg::Fog which
	  correspond to the
	  FogCoord support added to osg::Geometry. Added suppot for these
	  new parameters
	  to the .osg plugin.

2002-08-20 08:14  robert

	* Reordered the string comparions so that DEBUG_INFO comes before
	  INFO, since
	  the find op will find INFO in a DEBUG_INFO string, and hence
	  report the wrong
	  notify level.

2002-08-19 19:53  robert

	* Added default values to the TexEnvCombine constructor.

2002-08-19 15:14  robert

	  and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(angle1,axis1,angle2,axis2,angle3,axis3)
	  method.
	  
	  Made osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(heading,pitch,roll) all deprecated API.
	  
	  Fixed the Quat*Quat & Quat*=Quat multiplication methods so that
	  they multiplied
	  in the correct order - they were reversed originally due to the
	  Quat code being
	  based on code example which used the v' = M v ordering, rather
	  than the OSG's
	  v' = v M ordering.

2002-08-18 11:16  robert

2002-08-13 15:31  robert

	* Futher improvements and fixes to osg::AnimationPath, and the
	  osglight
	  demo to show it action.

2002-08-13 13:22  robert

	* Made improvements to osg::AnimationPath, added
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform::AnimationPathCallback which us an
	  app callback
	  which uses an AnimationPath to specify the new positions of the
	  transform.
	  
	  Added AnimationPath code to osglight to animate the positional
	  light.
	  
	  Added CullVisitor::setCullingMode() code into SceneView so that
	  SceneView's
	  CullingMode is now properly passed onto CullVisitor. Note, this
	  work
	  had been done before, but must has been lost in a merge. Umm...

2002-08-13 09:35  robert

	* Fixed uninitialized _sortMode.

2002-08-12 17:40  robert

	* Added new s/getPivotPoint() support to

2002-08-12 13:42  robert

	* Updates to DOFTransform so that its overrides the traverse() and
	  compute*() methods
	  rather than depending upon callbacks for animating and compute
	  matrices. Merged the
	  put/inverseput code between Sasa's and Ferndinand's DOF code.
	  
	  From Bora Utka, Added support to osg::Sequence/OpenFlight
	  AnimNode to the flt plugin.

2002-08-12 13:37  robert

	* attempt to fix read only status of Sequence.cpp.

2002-08-11 21:26  robert

	* Removed dependency of the new osg::DOFTransform and osg::Sequence
	  Node's
	  on osgUtil by implementing a NodeVisitor::VisitorType enum, and
	  associated
	  g/setVisitorType. This allows callbacks to querry the
	  visitor/traversal
	  type without doing down cast's to specific visitor subclasses
	  such as
	  osgUtil::AppVisitor/CullVisitor.

2002-08-11 10:32  robert

	* Temporarily commented out the flat staic transforms visitor since
	  it
	  was causing problems with the new DOFTransform class.

2002-08-09 19:51  robert

	* Submission for Gideon May, fixes for spacing in various osgText
	  files.

	  types of
	  billboards in action.

2002-08-08 21:36  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX 32bit timmer on O2. From Tom Jolley.

	  truncated, spotted by Tom Jolly.

2002-08-08 15:09  robert

	* Removed inline definition from front of setMaxAnisotropy method.

2002-08-08 13:45  robert

	* Fixed typos, sent in by Warren Macchi.

2002-08-08 13:41  robert

	* Fixed bug related to switching on/off culling modes. Patch from
	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-08-08 11:27  robert

	* Changed the Geometry::setVertexArray and GeoSet::setCoords so
	  that they
	  call dirtyBound() instead of reseting the local bound flag, this
	  ensures
	  the updates are propagated upwards through into the parents.

2002-08-08 11:01  robert

	* Fixed the shininess factor in 3ds plugin.

2002-08-07 15:52  robert

	* Changed the support for anisotropic filtering in osg::Texture so
	  that it
	  is now controlled via the setMaxAnisotropy(float) method, and is
	  set up
	  independently for the mag filter mode, which it previously was
	  done.

2002-08-07 10:10  robert

2002-08-06 17:07  robert

	* Added shells for DOFTransform and PositionAttitudeTransform to
	  the .osg
	  loader, still need to fill in the saving and loading of
	  paramters.
	  
	  Went through the distribution remove old API usage.

2002-08-06 10:37  robert

	* Changed the default value of _animationOn to true.

2002-08-06 10:07  robert

	* Fixed compile errors under IRIX.

2002-08-05 12:40  robert

	* Added support to StateAttribute/State to support PROTECTED flag
	  for modes and attributes
	  so that they cannot be overriden from above via the OVERRIDE
	  flag. This is
	  useful for things like manipulators that have handles display in
	  the scene, you
	  might want to prevent their state being affected by other
	  overriding of
	  light, wireframe modes etc.

2002-08-04 21:11  robert

	* Fix to iv/vrml loader so that it correctly passes back the right

	  plugin.
	  Removed main.cpp * .h moving all its functionality into
	  readerwriter.cpp.

2002-08-04 20:51  robert

	* Changed the error reporting so that it directs it all via
	  osg::notify, and
	  only uses the INFO level for reporting that the file to load is
	  not
	  recognised. Also add check for LWO2 loading so that it returns
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED
	  message correctly.

2002-08-04 20:34  robert

	* From Ruben Lopez, updates to VRML/IV loader.
	  
	  From Ben Discoe, corrections to comments in osg::Transform
	  
	  From Alberto Barbati, Lazy evaluation of inverse matrix in

	* Added support for a sort callback in RenderBin.

2002-08-03 16:48  robert

	* Fixed comments.

2002-08-03 16:37  robert

	* Added cout's of the view frustum to the aid debugging, these
	  cout's are
	  now commented out, and are just left in so that they may be used
	  to
	  double check things in future.

2002-08-02 19:11  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build

2002-08-02 15:14  robert

	* Added missing _nodePath.clear() and _segHitList.clear() to
	  InteresectVisitor::reset().

	  how big
	  the initial texture is.

2002-07-28 23:27  robert

	* Checked in Pavel's updates for non texured surfaces.

2002-07-28 21:25  robert

	* Added set/getUnrefImageOnApply() methods and associated flag and
	  code in Texture::apply() to set the _image to 0 on apply. Note,
	  this will only work when you have a single graphics context, as
	  with multiple graphics contexts one can't delete the image after
	  the first apply, as there will be more than one texture object to
	  update.

2002-07-28 21:15  robert

	* Checked in Marco's commented out #defines/rejigged struct names
	  to get things
	  compiling under Windows, will need to check this in future as it
	  may change with regeneration of parser files
	  with lex/yacc.

2002-07-28 12:52  robert

	* Chagned the initiliazation of iterators, sent in by Alberto

	  increases
	  fog density.

2002-07-23 15:01  robert

	* Mods for HP-UX port.

2002-07-23 14:35  robert

	* Added mode checking into StateSet to try and catch non texture

	  fix report
	  uninitialized variables.

2002-07-21 10:04  robert

	* Futher work on ensuring that all datatypes are initilizaed in OSG

	  or off
	  with the OSG_MM_CHECK_ON_ALLOCATIONS environmental variable.

2002-07-20 21:37  robert

	* Added some extra checks for memory initialization into the
	  osg::MemoryManager,
	  this is turned off by default, even in debug build. However you
	  can turn it
	  on by setting the OSG_MM_CHECK_FOR_UNINITIALIZED

2002-07-20 18:27  robert

	* Umm... these should have already been commited, not sure why cvs
	  has just
	  popped these ones up...

2002-07-20 16:24  don

2002-07-19 09:10  robert

	* Changed the "reflect.rgb" path to "Images/reflect.rgb" to the
	  help find the
	  file required.

2002-07-18 22:35  robert

	* Updates NEWS file for 0.9.0 release.
	  
	  Added default computeBound() implementation to osg::Drawable
	  which uses
	  a PrimtiveFunctor to compute the bounding box in a generic way,
	  that
	  will work for all Drawable subclasses that implement the
	  accept(PrimitiveFunctor&).

2002-07-18 22:34  robert

	* Added osgoccluder to test scripts.

2002-07-18 19:54  robert

	* Moved the 't' operation on texture modes across to use the new
	  StateSet::setTextureMode methods, this enables 't' to work once
	  more!

2002-07-18 19:54  robert

	* Updated docs ready for the release.

2002-07-18 19:41  robert

	* Moved get/setUserData from osg::Node into its superclass
	  osg::Object to
	  allow other subclasses to add their own custom data.

2002-07-18 15:36  robert

	* Rewrote the osg::Drawable::AttributeFunctor and PrimtiveFunctor
	  to make
	  them more consistent with each other. This does mean an API
	  change, so
	  dependanct code in the OSG has been updated accordingly.

2002-07-18 15:28  robert

	* From Randall Hopper, warning fixes for IRIX.

2002-07-18 15:25  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, fix the TexturePaletteRecord::endian() to
	  handle
	  old flt versions (11, 12 & 13).

2002-07-18 14:29  robert

	* From Brede Johansen
	  "I have found one bug in the ConvertFromFLT::visitFace()
	  function. In the
	  early days of the Flight format, before the LightPoint record
	  existed
	  they used face records with a light (-point) attribute."

2002-07-18 14:20  robert

	* Rewrote osg:Statistics so that it is PrimitiveFunctor as is now
	  completely
	  decoupled from osg::Drawable. The Drawable::getStats() virtual
	  method
	  no longer exists.
	  
	  Updated the Viewer to use the osg::Statistics incarnation and
	  reformated stats
	  to clean it up.

2002-07-18 10:55  robert

	* Added code into osg::LightSource so it correctly computes its
	  bounding
	  sphere, taking into account any subgraph below, and the light
	  itself
	  if it is not a infinite light.

2002-07-18 10:49  robert

	* Updated the test scripts to include cube mapping example and
	  osglight demo.

2002-07-18 10:41  robert

	* Removed repeated return transform in the visitDOF method.

2002-07-18 10:38  robert

	* Added support for .sgi alias extension to the .rgb plugin.

2002-07-18 10:06  robert

	* Fixed warnings.

2002-07-18 09:55  robert

	* Converted the osg::Material::set/getShininess option to use the
	  standard
	  OpenGL range of 0.0 to 128.0 instead of the previous normalised
	  shiniess
	  range. This brings it inline with the way the rest of the OSG
	  uses a
	  1 to 1 mapping to OpenGL.
	  
	  Converted the various loaders to use the new range, which is
	  almost all
	  cases was simply removing the /128.0f which was required before!

2002-07-18 09:17  robert

	* Added const to LessGeometry functor to fix Win32 build.

2002-07-18 00:55  robert

	* Fixed spelling mistake.

2002-07-18 00:53  robert

	  where they
	  share the same state and bindings.

2002-07-17 16:24  robert

	* Changed from a -> to *() when using the object pointed to by a
	  reverse iterator,
	  to fix problems with build under VS6/STLport.

2002-07-17 12:21  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-07-17 10:00  robert

	* Several items of work related to adding a manual creation of
	  occluders
	  option to the osgoccluder demo.
	  
	  First the osgGA classes have been generalised a little to better
	  support
	  new GUIEventHandler subclasses.
	  
	  Second osgGLUT has a new option for registering a user defined
	  event handler,
	  the allows the application to add externally extra options to the
	  osgGLUT viewer.
	  
	  Third, the osgoccluder demo now works in two modes. The original
	  create
	  four occluder sides to wrap an loaded model, the second an
	  interactive
	  mode which allows the users to add occluders to the model by
	  pointing
	  to points and pressing 'a' to add a point, the 'e' to end the
	  occluder
	  polygon, polygons must be convex, planer and be defined in an
	  anitclockwise
	  order. To start the osgoccluder in this mode one simple runs it
	  with the
	  '-c' option. Run osgoccluder with no parameter to get a list of
	  options.

2002-07-16 20:07  robert

	* Updated docs and added osgGA

2002-07-16 19:21  robert

2002-07-16 15:28  robert

	* Rewrote the apply_imp template method so that it takes an
	  initialization
	  paramater.

2002-07-16 15:13  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build from Bob Kuehne.

2002-07-16 15:12  robert

2002-07-15 22:23  robert

	* Added support to osgUtil::Tesselator to insert extra vertices and
	  other
	  attributes into an osg::Geometry node. Uses the new
	  osg::ArrayVisitor.
	  
	  Converted the osg plugin Geometry support to use the new UByte4
	  class.

2002-07-15 22:18  robert

	* Added osg::UByte4 class, which can be used to represent packed
	  colors.
	  
	  Changed osg::UByte4Array across to use the new osg::UByte4 class
	  rather
	  than a GLuint as do previously.
	  
	  Cleaned up some of the paramters in osg::Vec4.

2002-07-15 13:39  robert

	* Removed the second texture from the prerender demo so as not over
	  complicate
	  the final image.

2002-07-15 13:20  robert

	* Fixed the orientation of the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane
	  is orientated towards the viewer.
	  
	  Changed the lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of
	  0.0, so that
	  a small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces.
	  The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected behaviors
	  because of
	  no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 13:14  robert

	* Added a MatrixTransform to tilt the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection
	  plane is seen clearly.

2002-07-15 10:45  robert

	* Renamed osghangglide demo.

2002-07-15 10:43  robert

	* Renamed the hangglide demo osghangglide to make it consistent
	  with the rest
	  of the demos.

2002-07-15 10:03  robert

	* Added State::disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding( unit )
	  method so that
	  all unsed texture units can be turned off simply within Drawables
	  such
	  as Geometry and GeoSet. This can be used to prevent bleed of
	  arrays from
	  one object to the next - which can cause crashes.

2002-07-13 21:17  robert

	* Fixed various warnings which were appearing under MacOSX.

2002-07-13 20:31  robert

	* Conveted GeoSet to use the new state::set*Pointer/disable*Pointer
	  methods
	  to keep the current state valid.

2002-07-13 14:16  robert

	* Support added for multitextured TXP files, sent in by Boris
	  Bralo.

2002-07-13 02:46  don

	* put a typedef in public area of class for sun compilers

2002-07-12 21:45  robert

2002-07-12 21:08  robert

	* Added MatrixTransform header and source.

2002-07-12 19:50  robert

	* Changed the osgmultitexture demo so that it uses a TexEnv::BLEND
	  mode
	  with a colour. This lightens the resultant models.

2002-07-12 18:14  robert

	* Added using namespace osgUtil to get round IRIX/Windows compiler
	  differences.

2002-07-12 18:12  robert

	* Ported distribution across to use the new osg::MatrixTransform
	  and osg::BlendFunc
	  class instead of osg::Transform and osg::Transparancy
	  respectively.

2002-07-12 14:25  robert

	* Have added a #define USE_DEPRECATED_API to include/osg/Export,
	  and
	  various
	  osg header and source files to optional compile in deprecated
	  parts of
	  the
	  OSG API.
	  
	  Have renamed osg::Transparency osg::BlendFunc to bring it in line
	  with
	  the
	  rest of the OSG's StateAttribute classes which are named after
	  their
	  OpenGL counterparts. include/osg/Transparency still exists and is
	  simply
	  a typedef to BlendFunc and is enclosed in a #ifdef
	  USE_DEPRECTATED_API
	  block.
	  
	  The matrix methods in the osg::Transform class have been
	  moved/replicated in
	  a osg::MatrixTransform sublcass from osg::Transform. The old
	  matrix
	  functionality is still present in the osg::Transform class but is
	  guard
	  by #ifdef USG_DEPRECATED_API blocks. One should now think of
	  osg::Transform
	  as being a Transform Node base class. MatrixTransform has all the
	  functionality of the original Transform class, so should be used
	  instead.

2002-07-12 13:00  robert

	* Fix, sent in by Macro Jez, to the set of the camera with the
	  computed near and far plane, so that
	  it is only updated when _computeNearFar !=
	  CullVisitor::DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR.

2002-07-12 10:30  robert

	* Added blend color to osg::TexEnv

2002-07-12 09:16  robert

2002-07-12 08:48  robert

	* Addition of RoadRecords from Yefei He.

2002-07-11 23:30  don

	* added -lpthread to the link line for Linux builds. Seems Red Hat
	  7.3
	  turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 21:08  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-07-11 18:33  robert

	* Added Makefile for osgmultitexture demos.

2002-07-11 16:12  robert

	* Added support for multitexturing to osg::State and added
	  osgmultitexture
	  demo which adds as spherical environment map using texture 1 to
	  any model.

2002-07-11 14:32  robert

	* Moved the code referencing osg::BoundingBox::isValid() and
	  osg::BoundingSphere::isValid() across to use the valid() methods,
	  the later
	  being more consitent with other classes such as osg::ref_ptr<>.

2002-07-11 12:57  robert

	* Fixes for win32 build

2002-07-11 11:36  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

	  where it
	  should have been a '>='.

2002-07-11 11:08  robert

	* Fixed the pathname for the osgprerender demo.

	* changed unsigned int/short/char* references to
	  GLuint,GLushort,GLubyte respectively.

2002-07-10 22:38  robert

	* Updates for new use of GLushort instead of osg::ushort in GeoSet
	  index pointer.

2002-07-10 22:33  robert

	* Tidied up the types in osg::GeoSet so that the index pointers use
	  GLushort
	  and GLuint to get round compile issues under MacOSX.

2002-07-10 20:30  robert

	* Updates to osg::Drawable::AppCallback and osgprerender demo.

2002-07-10 15:35  robert

	* Added app callback to Drawable.

2002-07-10 13:33  robert

	* Updates to osgprerender to support use of rendering to an image,
	  rather then
	  just a texture.

2002-07-10 11:26  robert

	* Rejigged the line endings.

2002-07-10 11:22  robert

	* Ported all the demos and loaders across to use the new
	  multitexturing API.

2002-07-10 09:32  robert

	* Added Yefei He's RoadRecords to the flt loader, these records
	  will be
	  ignored by the loader, but will allow the loader to skip over
	  them and
	  continue reading the rest of the file correctly.

2002-07-10 09:14  robert

	* Updates from Macro to support the new multitexture API, and
	  improve
	  bounding box computation.

	* Added setCurrentRenderBin() method.

2002-07-09 19:23  robert

	* Implemented more code for the new osgprerender demo.

2002-07-09 13:31  robert

	* Updates to the osgprerender code. Still doesn't do anything
	  interesting yet..

2002-07-09 13:17  robert

	* Added new demo osgprerender to demonstrate how to prerender a
	  scene and use
	  the result in the main rendering for special effects.

2002-07-09 10:33  robert

	* Warnings fixes for IRIX - there was a missing "const" in the
	  sameKindAs(.) method.

2002-07-09 10:23  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.

2002-07-09 09:35  robert

	* Implemented most of the changes required for supporting
	  multitexturing in
	  the osg::State/osg::StateSet/osg::StateAttribute and related
	  classes.

2002-07-08 09:42  robert

	* Added Mike Connell to authors list.

2002-07-07 22:12  robert

	* Added comment to reflect Clay Fowlers findings on getting VS to
	  compile
	  without the Vector wrapper classes.

2002-07-07 22:08  robert

	* Added winsock32 libs to osgcluster demo.

2002-07-07 20:16  robert

	* Rehashed the osgcluster project file to see if it solves the
	  failure under
	  windows.

2002-07-07 17:42  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build.

2002-07-07 17:40  robert

	* Added include<unistd.h> to __DARWIN_OSX__ build.

2002-07-07 17:30  robert

	* Did a to_dos on osgcluster.dsp since it was original saved with
	  unix file endings.

2002-07-07 14:40  robert

	* Work on supporting multitexturing in
	  State/StateSet/StateAttribute/Geoemtry.

2002-07-04 18:47  robert

	* Added VisualStudio files for Win32 port of osgcluster demo.

2002-07-04 18:41  robert

	* Added support for Win32 broadcast and recience over lan. Changes
	  sent in
	  by Michael Gronager.

2002-07-04 14:49  robert

	* Used typedef's for std::vector<>'s used inside DrawElements
	  implementations.
	  
	  Added deperecated comment to osg::GeoSet header.

2002-07-04 14:23  robert

	* Added osgGA to the MIGNW makedefs.

2002-07-04 09:49  robert

	* Fixed the TriangleFunctor QUAD_STRIP code so that it produces
	  consistent
	  results.

2002-07-03 20:33  robert

	* Spotted by Neil Salter - missing transform. in the Transform copy
	  operator.

2002-07-03 11:16  robert

	* Added osgUtil dependency to the flt project.

2002-07-02 19:53  robert

	* Reimplemted the osgUtil::SceneView::setCalcNearFar()
	  functionality to bring
	  it inline with the CullStack/CullVisitor implementation. Also
	  added the
	  setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize() method and wired them up inside
	  SceneView.cpp so they set the corresponding CullVisitor
	  paramters.
	  
	  Intergrated pfImage copying change in the Performer plugin,
	  submission sent in by Ulrich Hertlein

2002-07-02 15:01  don

	* -n32 and -64 entries were reversed in makedefs

2002-07-02 06:28  don

	* osgcallback required fixes for new osg::Drawable::CullCallback

2002-07-02 06:22  don

	* Added support for CullVisitor to contain a osg::State. This used
	  when
	  cull Callbacks require the contextID for doing operations on
	  texture
	  objects, for example. Modified CullVisitor SceneView and Drawable

2002-07-01 14:40  don

	* More 64 bit build specifics in IRIX makedefs file

2002-07-01 14:20  don

	* Removed -ldl from makedefs for IRIX

2002-06-28 22:42  robert

	* Rewrote the osgUtil::Tesselator so that it is easier to use, and
	  can also
	  easily retesselate osg::Primitive::POLYGONS found in Geometry
	  objects.
	  Added calls to the tesselate to the lwo and flt loaders.

2002-06-28 20:54  robert

	* A couple fixes to remove Performer runtime warnings.

2002-06-28 16:25  robert

	* Fixes from Ulrich Hertlein to build of pfb plugin. Small mods to
	  these
	  by Robert.

2002-06-28 14:42  robert

	* Added to the osggeometry demo.

2002-06-28 11:11  robert

	* Rewriting the osggeomtry demo to illustrate more primitive types.

2002-06-28 08:47  robert

	* Removed commas from the end of enum lists.

2002-06-28 08:36  robert

	* Change =0 to osg::Vec2Array::iterator() in .obj loader to get
	  round warnings
	  under gcc3.0.x

2002-06-27 20:29  robert

	* Ported the flt plugin across to use osg::Geometry, it still uses
	  a GeoSet
	  internally, and I will remove this after some futher work.

2002-06-27 15:18  robert

	* Added SG_EXPORT which was missing.

2002-06-27 13:15  robert

	* Converted the template DrawElements primitive class into three
	  seperate
	  non templated classes - UByteDrawElements, UShortDrawElements,
	  UIntDrawElements.

2002-06-27 10:50  robert

	* Moved the AttributeArray and Primitive classes into their own
	  header and
	  source files.

2002-06-27 09:56  robert

	* Removed the test aginst a iterator as a bool.

2002-06-26 21:11  robert

	* Added comment to explain #ifdefs for member templates.

2002-06-26 21:10  robert

	* Added #idef to Export to add check for support for member
	  templates.

2002-06-26 21:08  robert

	* Ported LWO loader across to use osg::Geometry. Work not quite
	  complete,
	  as we need to retesselate any concave polygons that can exists in
	  these
	  datasets.

2002-06-26 17:48  robert

	* Added templated constructor to TemplateArray & DrawElements
	  template to
	  handle VisualStudio7.0 build.
	  
	  Ported 3DS across to use osg::Geometry instead of osg::GeoSet.

2002-06-26 14:34  robert

	* Ported pfb, txp and obj loaders across to use osg::Geometry.

2002-06-26 10:28  robert

	* Ported various demos and support classes over to use the new
	  osg::Geometry class
	  thus removing dependancy on osg::Geoset from most of the OSG,
	  only loaders
	  left to port now.

2002-06-25 20:47  robert

	* Fixes for Cygwin build from Norman Vine.

2002-06-25 20:36  robert

	* Fix to Quat::slerp so that it interpolates along the shortest
	  path.

2002-06-25 20:27  robert

	* Added osg::Drawable::PrimitiveFunctor and TriangleFunctor
	  subclass for
	  querrying the primitive data inside Drawables. Moved various
	  support
	  classes over from being osg::GeoSet based to osg::Geometry based.

2002-06-24 21:44  robert

	* Fixed osgText::Text::DrawModeType::ALIGNEMENT spelling mistake,
	  now
	  is ALIGNMENT.

2002-06-24 21:37  robert

	* Checked in .osg support for the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-24 12:53  robert

	* Added required std:: to front of endl to fix Win32 build.

2002-06-23 21:43  robert

	* Added conversion to osg::GeoSet::converToGeometry() utility to
	  help the
	  migration to and testing of the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-22 15:46  robert

	* Compile Fixes for Win32.

2002-06-21 19:24  robert

	* Temporarily removed the references to multi-texturing calls.

2002-06-21 16:45  robert

	* Added new osggeometry demo to test the work on the new
	  osg::Geometry Drawable.

2002-06-21 15:14  robert

	* Bug fix to the size calculation of bmp images, changed both the
	  reading and
	  writing of images.

2002-06-21 07:48  robert

	* Fixed constructor for TemplateArray(const TemplateArray& t,const
	  CopyOp& copyop).

2002-06-20 19:54  robert

	* Addd new experimental osg::Geometry Drawable which will
	  eventually replace
	  GeoSet. Currently doesn't draw anything, and is very much in the
	  early design stages.

2002-06-20 18:17  robert

	* Mods to MemoryManager to make the optimized build produce dummy
	  implementations for all the public functions found in the header,
	  this should prevent problems when not compiling in the
	  MemoryManager
	  under IRIX 64 build.

2002-06-19 20:38  robert

	* Fixed incorrect naming of ConvexPlanerOccluder.

2002-06-19 18:45  robert

	* Added support for reading the new OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
	  environmental variable
	  inside the osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing() method. The
	  smallest of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE and OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is used
	  for the
	  final max texture size.
	  
	  This new env. var. allows users to deliberate cap the size of
	  their textures
	  so they can test whether their models are limited by texture
	  memory. If
	  reducing the max texture size increases performance then you are
	  limited
	  by texture memory!

2002-06-19 16:06  robert

	* Added support for reading and writing OccluderNode's to the .osg
	  file format.

2002-06-19 15:18  robert

	* Added computation of the bounding volume of osg::OccluderNodes.
	  
	  Added support for
	  osg::BoundingSphere::expandBy*(osg::BoundingBox) and have
	  added osg::BoundingSphere/Box::valid() which deprecates
	  isValid(), this
	  is to be more consistent with other classes in the OSG.

2002-06-19 10:19  robert

	* Added support for occlusion of holes in occluders, and cleaned up
	  the
	  interface to ShadowVolumeOccluders.

2002-06-19 08:34  robert

	* Changed the osg::LightSource so its Light attribute is now
	  generalised to
	  be a StateAttribute. This allows alternative implementations of
	  Lights
	  other than the standard osg::Light.

2002-06-18 22:35  robert

	* Added support for occluders occluding other occluders, which
	  helps reduce
	  the number of occluder that will be used in cull traversal to
	  only the
	  ones that will be effective. Note. Holes in occluders arn't
	  handled in
	  this occluder occlusion test, will implement this later.

2002-06-18 10:18  robert

	* Clean ups for the Windows build.

2002-06-18 09:09  robert

	* Added the length argument to a std::string argument, under Linux
	  it
	  compiled with the default value npos, under Windows it broke the
	  build,
	  add the npost excpilicity should get round this difference in
	  implementation.

2002-06-17 21:50  robert

	* Rewrote the FileUtils support for data and library file paths,
	  moving the
	  storage of the path lists into osgDB::Registry, and changed the
	  data
	  structor from a char* to a std::deque. Changed a names of couple
	  of the
	  convinience functions in osgDB/FileUtils to better reflect the
	  two
	  public FilePathList's - DataFilePathList and the
	  LibraryFilePathList.
	  
	  Added support into the osgDB::Registry::readNode/Image/Object
	  methods
	  for pushing and popping the path of the current file being
	  loaded.

2002-06-17 09:10  robert

	* Fixes to the occluder culling code to properly disable occluders
	  to prevent
	  self occlusion.

2002-06-15 20:57  robert

	* Fixes for Visual .NET and Mingw builds, and fix MacOSX notify()
	  crash.

2002-06-15 12:14  robert

	* Added computation of occluders volume scaled relative to the
	  frustum volume,
	  all volumes computed in eye coords.

2002-06-14 16:28  robert

	* Added computation of the occluders volume, scale it to a ratio of
	  the
	  frustum.

2002-06-14 14:50  robert

	* Added occluder hole test code into the osgoccluder demo. The code
	  works,
	  but I've commented it out right now as the Geode physically
	  representing
	  the occluder doesn't yet have a hole in it - just a cosmetic
	  thing.

2002-06-14 13:49  robert

	* Refined the CollectOccluderVisitor so that it checks the subgraph
	  below
	  a node contains occluders before traversing.

2002-06-14 11:27  robert

	* Improvements to the plane clipping code.

2002-06-14 08:45  robert

	* Further updates to the occlusion culling code, also adding
	  missing OccludeNode
	  file the .osg plugin.

2002-06-13 23:46  robert

	* Further work on occlusion culling.

2002-06-13 19:39  don

	* removed the use of gettimeofday for 32 bit architectures...

2002-06-13 19:34  robert

	* Added #include <osg/ref_ptr> so that it will compile properly
	  regardless
	  of include order.

2002-06-13 19:10  robert

	* Added -osgGA to the Makefile list.

2002-06-13 18:27  robert

	* Merge Randall's changes.

2002-06-13 16:21  robert

	* Further work on Occlusion Culling. Most of work is complete, just
	  debugging
	  required now.

2002-06-12 16:23  robert

	* Removed inappropriate inline keyword which was breaking the IRIX
	  build.

2002-06-12 15:43  robert

	* IRIX build fix.

2002-06-12 14:57  robert

	* Changes for MacOSX build, send in by Bob Kuehne.

2002-06-12 14:46  robert

	* Fixed the osgDB::getFilePath, osgDB::getSimpleFileName() and
	  osgDB::getStrippedName()
	  so that they check for both unix style '/' and windows style '\'
	  slashes in
	  file names.

2002-06-12 13:54  robert

	* Fix for renaming of ShadowOccluderVolume to ShadowVolumeOccluder.

2002-06-12 09:22  robert

	* Further work on occludision code.

2002-06-11 19:52  robert

	* A little more work on Occlusion culling.

2002-06-11 18:41  robert

	* Checked in Macro Jez's additions to osgText to support .osg IO
	  make it
	  a fully functioning NodeKit.
	  
	  Also reimplement notify() to try an prevent a crash which has
	  been caused by
	  to objects in notify.cpp being initiliazed twice, the second time
	  the auto_ptr
	  holding the dev/null ofstream was being initilized to 0.

2002-06-10 13:50  robert

	* Added osg::CollectOccludersVisitor which is a helper class for
	  finding active
	  occluder in the view frustum, to be used as pre cull traversal.

2002-06-10 11:21  robert

	* Created new helper class osg::CullStack to handle the
	  accumulation of projection,
	  modelview and culling sets, to be used during travesal of the
	  scene graph, such
	  as the cull traversal.

2002-06-09 13:10  robert

	* Checked in migration from osgUtil based GUIAdapter code to Neil
	  Salter's
	  osgGA (Gui Abstraction). This may break users code, but all it
	  should
	  require to fix the builds should be a change from
	  osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and
	  include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to
	  osgGA/CameraManipulator and
	  the extra dependency of the link line.

2002-06-08 19:58  robert

	* More more occlusion culling.

2002-06-07 20:03  robert

	* Added osgoccluder demo, it creates a single quad occluder, but
	  the culling
	  code is not complete yet, so it won't actually do any occlusion
	  culling,
	  the demo is here so I can test the evolving occlusion culling
	  code.

2002-06-07 14:54  don

	* #ifdefed out cstdlib for irix

2002-06-07 13:57  robert

	* Added default IntersectVisitor::_hitReportingMode to be
	  ONLY_NEAREST_HIT.

2002-06-07 11:32  robert

	* Fixed a couple of problems with the NodeKit support.

2002-06-07 10:03  robert

	* Added support for NodeKits to the osgDB::Registry. Object names
	  in .osg
	  files which have the library::class syntax will automatically
	  invoke
	  the dynamic loading of either a nodekit or database plugin.

2002-06-06 14:00  robert

	* Fixed crash in loading osg files which have object types which
	  arn't recognized.

2002-06-06 13:25  robert

	* Addd libraryName() method to osg::Object in preperation for the
	  osgDB support
	  for node kits plugins.

2002-06-05 16:11  robert

	* Removed out of date comment on calling dirtyTransform() which no
	  longer exist
	  in osg::Camera.

2002-06-05 16:00  robert

	* Renamed the osgparticle demo so that it wouldn't clash with the
	  osgParticle library.

2002-06-05 14:14  robert

	* Fixed compile problems under VisualStudio6.0

2002-06-05 13:51  robert

	* Added OSGPARTICLE_LIBRARY define.

2002-06-05 13:11  robert

	* Another try at fixing wayward VisualStudio.dsw file.

2002-06-05 13:06  robert

2002-05-22 19:58  don

	* Fixed spelling error Calander -> Calendar

2002-05-22 12:19  robert

2002-05-22 10:04  robert

	* Changed the public osg::State::applyMode() and applyAttribute
	  methods so that

	  workings of osg::State.

2002-05-21 08:59  robert

	* Added osg::State::getCurrentMode and
	  osg::State::getCurrentAttribute().
	  
	  Aded osg::clampAbove(..) and osg::clampBelow() template functions
	  to
	  include/osg/Math.

2002-05-21 00:58  don

	* Modified instrules so that the functionality of instlinks is that
	  system links are not made to point to links, rather the real
	  files. So
	  links installed on a system are pointing to platform specific
	  files rather
	  than links that may be pointing to files of the wrong platform
	  type.

2002-05-18 08:39  robert

	* Fixed problem with orhographic projections due to a bug in
	  CullVisitor
	  where it automatically resets the near and far to the values
	  calculated
	  during cull traversal. The maths for converting the computed far
	  and near
	  into clip coordinates was wrong, fixed this and the problem goes
	  away.

2002-05-15 11:27  robert

	* Exposed the CullVisitor::setComputeNearFarMode

2002-05-14 10:20  robert

2002-05-09 18:59  robert

	* Added pixelSize method to CullVisitor, and converted small
	  feature
	  culling to use the pixelSize method instead of a ratio of radius
	  to
	  distance from eye point. setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize() method
	  has also been added to provide the user with finer control of
	  small
	  featyre culling.

2002-05-09 10:31  robert

	* Added new osgGA - GUI Adapter library submitted by Neil Salter.

	  scene.
	  
	  Added osgclip demo to the test suite.

2002-05-02 22:02  robert

	* Made osg::Viewport::getViewport(..) const.

	* A more verbose version of the test script, using each and more
	  memleaks.log
	  to print out progress and report any memory leaks which have been
	  logged.
	  The later will only occur with a debug build. The use of echo and
	  more
	  makes this version osgtest.bat not portable to windows
	  unfortuntately.

2002-04-25 10:14  robert

	* Added another bullet point to the plan.

2002-04-25 10:10  robert

	* Temporily removing to change it to a binary file.

2002-04-24 20:57  robert

	* Merged Bob's changes for MacOSX build. This change is simply the
	  addition of
	  GLUT_LIB to the link line. This change should be removed once we
	  fixed the
	  OSG_LIBS so that it doens't include osgGLUT, however, I'll leave
	  this for another
	  day...

2002-04-24 20:36  robert

	* Fix for MacOSX build, making sure that the compresed tex image is
	  defined

	  problems with
	  VisualStudio .NET compile.
	  
	  Added support for OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL and OSG_FILE_PATH into the
	  relevant getenv
	  routines. This compliments the exisiting OSGNOTIFYLEVEL &
	  OSGFILEPATH which
	  are deprecated but still supported. The OSG_ version are more
	  consistent
	  with the rest of the env variables used in the OSG.

2002-04-24 14:14  robert

	* Updates to the documentation.

2002-04-24 13:08  robert

	  warning.

2002-04-23 13:59  robert

	* Seperated out the platform specific implementions of the file
	  search/access
	  routines - we now have FileUtils_Windows.cpp, FileUtils_Mac.cpp
	  and
	  FileUtils_Unix.cpp. The FileUtils_Mac.cpp is based on code
	  submitted
	  by Josh Portway and add uses the carbon API for searching for
	  files.

2002-04-23 13:12  robert

	* Addtional details on the OpenSceneGraph and support.

2002-04-23 11:03  robert

	  would be
	  cleared before entering the viewer main loop, this removes
	  memorymanager
	  a reported memory leak due to the viewer using exit() which
	  bypasses
	  the clean up on main itself.
	  
	  Added an osgNew to the ReaderWriterRGB.cpp to aid detected of
	  tracking of
	  memory leaks.

2002-04-23 10:34  robert

	* Fixed compile problems under VisualStudio w.r.t the new additions
	  for
	  precompiled mipmaps. Changed std::size_t to unsigned int.

2002-04-23 09:06  robert

	  Supported added for precompiled mip maps stored in osg::Image,
	  and read
	  by osg::Texture.
	  
	  Updates to TerraPage loader for support of compressed texture
	  images and
	  precompiled mip maps.

2002-04-22 19:41  robert

	* Added code in hangglide to move the earth sky around with the eye
	  point,
	  use osg::Transform::ComputeTransformCallback.

2002-04-22 14:54  robert

	* Added support for compute the near and far planes and then
	  applying to
	  the current projection matrix into CullVisitor itself. Similar
	  code to
	  support this has been moved out of SceneView completely.
	  
	  Added Matrix:: infront of the definition of the static
	  osg::Matrix::inverse(Matrix) method which was missing.

2002-04-22 09:55  robert

	* Slight changes to FAQ to make a little more relevant, it really
	  needs
	  a total re-write though.

2002-04-22 09:50  robert

	* Added test script which runs all the demos in the OSG to make
	  sure they
	  run ok. User has to verify they are correct visually.

2002-04-22 09:37  robert

	* Cleaned up the handling of the Viewport with
	  osg::SceneView/RenderStage
	  and CullVisitor so that the Viewport is now managed as part as
	  the global
	  stateset so that it can be pushed and popped like the rest of
	  state without
	  problems. This makes it easier to have multiple viewports within
	  one
	  scene graph.

2002-04-22 09:31  robert

	* Fixes the .mlt loading from Ben Discoe.

2002-04-21 22:05  robert

	* Updated TODO list.
	  
	  Converted AnimationPath so it is now subclassed from
	  osg::Transform::ComputeTransfromCallback()
	  so that it can be directly attached to the scene to move objects
	  about.
	  
	  Changed the osg::SateSet::setGlobalDefaults() so that is sets
	  GL_DEPTH_TEST
	  to ON.
	  
	  Added guards and creation of default helper classes in
	  osgGLUT::Viewer and
	  osgUtil::SceneView so that sensible defaults are used when no
	  settings
	  are used of
	  osg::State/StateSet,osgUtil::RenderStage/RenderGraph/CullVisitor.

2002-04-21 21:53  robert

	* Changed the implementation of
	  osg::Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) so that
	  it conforms to the OpenFlight convention of euler angles. Added
	  documentation
	  into Matrix and Quat to reflect this.
	  
	  Added so test code to osgcube for stress testing memory
	  allocation and deallocation.

	  current
	  modelview matrix rathan than an identity matrix, this matrix is
	  then modified
	  locally.
	  
	  Changed the osg::Matrix set methods so they are inline.
	  
	  Added a few useful comments to MemoryManager.cpp to help people
	  understand
	  the assert's better.

2002-04-16 21:39  don

	* Changed Linux makedepend flag from -MM to -M

2002-04-16 21:08  robert

	* Fixed the seveal hunderd warnings in TerraPage loader!

2002-04-16 15:44  robert

	* Fix to TXP plugin to handle to new osg::Image method naming.

2002-04-16 15:31  robert

	* Added clearing of seperation band between horizontal/vertical
	  split stereo
	  areas.

2002-04-16 15:21  don

	* Added makedirdefs via a request from Bob Kheune. This allows us
	  to edit
	  the DIRS cruft in a single file in the Make directory instead of
	  having
	  to edit multiple files. Also edited Makefiles that needed to
	  include
	  this file.
	  
	  Also cleaned up txp loader to compile with SunOS. This needs to
	  be retested
	  on other platforms.

2002-04-16 14:57  robert

	* Added osg::Image::setPixelFormat(..) and
	  setInternalTextureFormat(), and
	  renamed osg::Image::pixelFormat(),
	  internalTextureFormat(),dataType() to
	  osg::Image::getPixelFormat() etc. These changes are to bring it
	  more
	  into line with the style of the rest of the OSG.
	  
	  Updated the rest of the distribution to take account for these
	  names changes.

2002-04-16 14:09  robert

	* Purge on warnings under Linux.

2002-04-16 11:41  robert

	* Removed the cached matrices from osg::Camera, so that
	  osg::Camrea::getModelViewMatrix() and
	  osg::Camera::getProjectionMatrix() are
	  calculated on the fly. Removed various redudent methods,
	  including the
	  project and unproject methods which are better supported within
	  osgUtil::SceneView.
	  
	  Added a computeWindowMatrix() method to Viewport, to make it
	  easier to construct
	  a MV*P*W matrix for converting local coords into screen coords
	  and visa versa.
	  Converted SceneView and CullVisitor to use this new method.

2002-04-16 11:36  robert

	* Updates to the flt plugin from Brede Johansen.

2002-04-16 08:01  robert

	* Warnings fix.

2002-04-16 05:29  don

	* Fixed some boo-boos in makerpms for building demo source files...

2002-04-16 04:13  don

2002-04-15 19:12  robert

	* Added Makefile.inst which was not added ealier with the check in
	  osghud.

2002-04-15 14:45  don

	* Added Daniel Sjölie's request to use a default complier (CXX) in
	  makedefs.
	  Doing this only for Linux

2002-04-15 14:29  robert

	* Fixed error in project w.r.t name of source file.

2002-04-15 14:21  robert

	* Renamed Demos/osgtext/osgtext.dsp back to
	  Demos/osgtext/osgtextdemo.dsp

2002-04-15 13:15  robert

	* Added CullCallbacks to osg::Node, and osgUtil::CullVisitor.

2002-04-15 11:03  robert

	* Added osghud, a head up display demo.

2002-04-15 10:59  robert

	* Fixes to warning in Win32 build

2002-04-15 08:51  robert

	* Fixed the copying of LongIDRecord's strings in flt plugin so it
	  now uses the record length-4,
	  to create the string. Also Removed some in appropriate comments
	  from LongIDRecord, since they
	  were obvious and hang over of a copy and paste job on the code.

2002-04-15 08:09  robert

	* Fixed display problem with the HUD in osgtext which was caused by
	  the
	  new mods to SceneView not honouring the z near/far calculation
	  flag.

2002-04-14 22:21  robert

	* Added support for specificing the eye mapping and seperation
	  between the
	  horizontal and veritical split stereo modes.
	  
	  Renamed osg::Image::ensureDimensionArePowerOfTwo() to
	  osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing().

2002-04-14 20:30  robert

	* Used a faster method for checking for power of 2 on the image
	  dimensions and
	  did a check on forcing 16bits textures in osg::Texture (which
	  speeds things
	  up on the Umea model which is performance bound by texture
	  memory.), the
	  later check is now commented out.

2002-04-14 13:41  robert

	* Fixes to osg::Image::createImage(..), and addition of code to
	  Viewer.cpp to support
	  output of screen snapshot via 'O'.

2002-04-14 12:54  robert

	* Addition of write .bmp to the BMP plugin.

2002-04-14 12:53  robert

	* Fix for crash in SceneView introduced when ungarded use of
	  _dispalySettings
	  pointer was added, a if (valid) guard has been added to solve the
	  problem.

2002-04-13 22:19  robert

	* Clean up for VisualStudio build

2002-04-13 18:53  robert

	* Added a space into the project name because it was confusing
	  VisualStudio.

2002-04-13 18:45  robert

	* Further changes to VisualStudio.dsw for dependancies.

2002-04-13 11:36  robert

	* Added dependanices into osgPlugins.

2002-04-13 11:08  robert

	* Fixed compile problem related to missing includes (a result of
	  removing include of Camera..)

2002-04-13 10:29  robert

	* Added dependancies to Demos.

2002-04-13 10:18  robert

	* Saved workspace from VisualStudio to follow up on missing demo
	  dependancies

2002-04-13 09:28  robert

	* Added Core infront of the names of the project dependancies.

2002-04-12 18:06  robert

	* Further work on cleaning up SceneView and Camera, in particular
	  moving strereo
	  support out of Camera and into SceneView. Also enabled the option
	  to set the
	  projection and modelview matrices directly on SceneView thereby
	  removing the
	  dependance on osg::Camrea to control the view of the scene.

2002-04-12 14:05  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build.

2002-04-12 13:06  robert

	* Futher updates to VisualStudio files, adding osgstereoimage and
	  osgversion in particular.

2002-04-12 12:51  robert

	* Added "Core " infront of the osg, osgDB, osgUtil, osgText, and
	  osgGLUT libraries
	  in the Visual Studio workspace/project files.

2002-04-12 12:15  robert

	* Renamed the osgtext demo project to reflect the name.

2002-04-12 11:57  robert

	* Added "Demo " and "osgPlugin " infront of all demo and plugin
	  project names to
	  help differentiate them within VisualStudio.

2002-04-12 10:24  robert

	* Attempt to add osgPlugin infront of the 3ds name to force
	  VisualStudio to
	  present it as plugin in the browser.

2002-04-12 10:12  robert

	* Reorganised the names of libraries and Demos to make it clear
	  what is what.

2002-04-12 09:53  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* Removed double reference of osgtexture

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* Removed Metroweks files since they wern't being used, and were
	  not up to
	  date. An attempt at using Metrowerks for MacOSX build failed, and
	  we
	  have Cywgin/Mingwin VisualStudio for windows so there is little
	  need for it.

2002-04-12 08:01  robert

	* Removed dangling references to NewCullVisitor from osgUtil.dsp.

2002-04-12 06:18  don

	* Solaris PKG distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell
	  archived)
	  changed makepgk to do this.
	  
	  Changed another one of those pesky cout = std::cout in
	  CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09  don

	* added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06  don

	* Added the 'make cleandepend' target to the build system.

2002-04-11 23:20  robert

	* Added DataVariance enum and set/get fields to osg::Object to help
	  identify
	  which objects have values that vary over the lifetime of the
	  object (DYNAMIC)
	  and ones that do not vary (STATIC). Removed the equivalent code
	  in
	  osg::Transform, StateSet and StateAttribute, as these are now
	  encompassed
	  by the new DataVariance field.
	  
	  Removed MatrixMode enum from Matrix, and associated
	  fields/parameters from
	  osg::Transfrom and osg::NodeVisitor, since MatrixMode was not
	  providing
	  any useful functionality, but made the interface more complex
	  (MatrixMode
	  was an experimental API)
	  
	  Added ReferenceFrame field to osg::Transform which allows users
	  to specify
	  transforms that are relative to their parents (the default, and
	  previous behavior)
	  or absolute reference frame, which can be used for HUD's, camera
	  relative
	  light sources etc etc. Note, the view frustum culling for
	  absolute Transform
	  are disabled, and all their parents up to the root are also
	  automatically
	  have view frustum culling disabled. However, once passed an
	  absolute Transform
	  node culling will return to its default state of on, so you can
	  still cull
	  underneath an absolute transform, its only the culling above
	  which is disabled.

2002-04-11 17:15  robert

	* Added several new methods to osg::Image to help keep track of
	  memory and added
	  osg::Image::readPixels to encapsulate glReadPixels.
	  
	  Reordering of includes in include/osg/Fog and include/osg/Light
	  to remove silly warnings under Visual Studio.

2002-04-11 17:13  robert

	* Patch to ReadWriter3DS from Mike Connel.

2002-04-11 16:05  don

	* Backed out bad addition of NewCUllVisitor

2002-04-11 15:54  don

	* Somehow, cvs forgot to check in a modified Makefile with
	  NewCullVisitor added
	  to it... Hm.. anyway this fixes it.

2002-04-11 13:53  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-04-11 09:16  robert

	* Changed the comments for Clay Fowlwer about the GLU patch for
	  RedHat7.2 to
	  reflect the new position of the tarball and its new name.

2002-04-11 08:24  robert

	* Fixed refrences to NewCullVisitor which has now been mapped onto
	  CullVisitor.

2002-04-10 22:10  robert

	* Copied NewCullVisitor over top of CullVisitor and then removed
	  NewCullVisitor.
	  
	  Added some defines to Image in prep for writing code to determine
	  how big a
	  pixel is.

2002-04-10 21:51  robert

	* Added new osg::DrawPixels class with encapsulates glDrawPixels as
	  and
	  osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource
	  nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 14:34  don

	* Added placeholder .README file to the PKG directory to keep CVS
	  from removing
	  the directory on an update.

2002-04-10 14:32  don

	* Removed big honkin' SUN PKG files from cvs distribution.

2002-04-10 01:29  don

	* Added (previously omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to
	  makedefs
	  in the Linux section

2002-04-09 22:54  don

	* Fixed makedepend to do the right thing.

2002-04-09 21:46  robert

	* Added setProjectionMatrix and setModelViewMatrix() methods to
	  osg::SceneView,
	  and associated member variables. I have not linked them up to the
	  cull traversal yet, but this will be the next task.

2002-04-09 16:09  robert

	* Further work on removing Camera references from NewCullVisitor
	  and releted
	  classes, this work paves the way for making osg::Camera an
	  optional
	  extra rather than a requirement for rendering.

2002-04-09 15:51  don

	* Checking in all Makefile.inst in src/Demos/*. These are the
	  Makefiles
	  that get installed rather than the build Makefiles.

2002-04-09 14:55  don

	* Added pkgadd distribution for Solaris.
	  
	  Added a cleaner way to install demo source so that installed
	  versions use a
	  simplified makedefs/makerules.
	  
	  Small fix to get osgText to compile with Solaris CC. Constructor
	  declared
	  with a non-const argument, but implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50  don

	* Added -lstdc++ to begining of LIBS on link line.. ??

2002-04-08 16:25  don

	* Put quotes around "DBGF" for multi argument

2002-04-08 08:23  robert

	* Changed a char* into const char* to fix Solaris build.

2002-04-08 08:22  robert

	* Fix for VisualStudio's lack of auto_ptr::reset.

2002-04-07 17:47  don

	* Added a stop gap fix for cygwin build. Previous experiements were
	  creating
	  library and plugin files that looked like system library and
	  system files
	  which would have deleted original files on a 'make install'.
	  Cygwin is not
	  tested yet, but this needed to get fixed before a cygwin user
	  wiped out his
	  system library files.

2002-04-06 09:24  robert

	* Updates to Makefile to reflect recent .cpp additions such as
	  TextureCubeMap,
	  MemoryManager etc.

2002-04-05 02:49  don

	* Fixed a small oversight in the previous bug fix. in
	  GeoSet::computeBound()
	  _numcoords is NOT necesarily _cindex._size.

2002-04-05 01:52  don

	* Edited INSTALL for new make and installation procedures.
	  Checking in a fix for Norman Vine
	  Added helprules and help.sh for a long-winded help message if you
	  'make help'.

2002-04-04 18:01  don

	* Added Norman Vine's changes for CYGWIN builds
	  
	  Added distrules and makerpms for building RPM distributions
	  
	  Removed old RedHatRPM distribution build directory
	  
	  Added new dist/RPM directory and placed temporary .spec files
	  (these
	  are generated by Make/makerpms and are not intended for
	  stand-alone
	  use, but they keep the directory warm and CVS happy)

2002-04-04 00:30  don

	* Fixed a small bug in compute bound that caused it to come up with
	  the
	  wrong number if the coord array was indexed, and containing bogus
	  (unindexed, yet in-line) numbers.

2002-04-03 17:53  don

	* Cleaned up in stallation directives

2002-04-03 17:42  don

	* Reinstated Norman Vine's TARGET_BASENAME variable in the
	  makefiles and
	  added prefixes and suffixes to libs and plugins. ALl this to
	  accomodate
	  cygwin...
	  
	  Also added INST_SYS_PREFIX and INST_SHARE_PREFIX for
	  installation, as well
	  as "standardizing" the install locations for the various
	  platforms.

2002-04-02 06:58  don

	* Oops forgot to add makedefs and makerules

2002-04-02 06:44  don

	* The new order for building OSG. All Makefiles are replaced and
	  the Make directory is left with four files only :
	  makedefs
	  makerules
	  makedirrules
	  instrules
	  
	  These work for all platforms supported so far, which include :
	  Linux
	  Irix
	  Solaris
	  MacOSX
	  Cygwin
	  FreeBSD

2002-04-02 06:27  don

	* Folded in Bob Kuehne's changes for Mac OSX to makedefs and
	  makerules

2002-04-01 15:37  don

	* Added cleanlite rules to makerules.new

2002-04-01 04:54  don

	* *** empty log message ***

2002-04-01 03:39  don

	* Completed and tested instrules.new

2002-03-31 16:43  don

	* Added more to instrules and makedefs.new Folded in Randall
	  Hopper's
	  changes for FreeBSD

2002-03-31 16:40  robert

	* Added new osg::Projection node, and osgUtil::NewCullVisitor which
	  are work
	  in progress for the new support for controlling the projection
	  matrix from
	  within the scene graph.
	  
	  Also Added osg::State::getClippingVolume(), getProjectionMatrix()
	  and
	  getModelViewMatrix() with allows drawables to access the current
	  projection,
	  and model view matrices and the view frustum in local coords to
	  the drawable.

2002-03-31 09:54  robert

	* Removed reference to malloc.h, replacing by stdlib.h instead.

2002-03-30 21:20  robert

	* Warnings fixes, submitted by Randall Hopper.

2002-03-30 15:13  robert

	* Fix for Cygwin build.

2002-03-29 17:26  robert

	* Move the applying of Projection and ModelView matrices into
	  osg::State so that
	  it now maintains references to the last applied matrices,
	  automatically doing
	  lazy state updating. This simplifies the various places in the
	  OSG which
	  were previously doing the applying, add paves the way for
	  managing the
	  projection matrix within the scene graph.
	  
	  Remove MemoryAdapter and mem_ptr as they arn't being used, and
	  can potentially
	  confuse users by their existance.

2002-03-29 12:23  robert

	* Converted from dos file endings to unix.

2002-03-29 12:23  robert

	* Fixes for dos endings in MemoryManager.cpp, and compile fix for
	  osgText for
	  Cygwin.

2002-03-29 06:54  don

	* Added new install rules for makefiles and updated makedefs and
	  makerules... more to come

2002-03-28 23:06  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.

2002-03-28 07:29  don

	* Couple a fixes in makedefs and makerules

2002-03-28 06:35  don

	* Added Norman Vines fixeds for cygwin

2002-03-27 23:04  robert

	* A compile fix to the new Texture subload changes.

2002-03-27 22:51  robert

	* Added support for setting the texture subload width and height
	  within
	  osg::Texture. The values default to 0, and in this state they are
	  sizes of the glTexSubImage2D are taken from the source image
	  size. This
	  allows the previous setup with no settings for subload size to
	  work as
	  before.

2002-03-27 16:31  robert

	* Futher updates to MemoryManager, fixed memory leak in osgconv.

2002-03-27 14:56  robert

	* Updates to various files, replacing delete calls with osgDelete
	  so that
	  greater debugging info can be gleaned.

2002-03-27 10:52  robert

	* Added support for VERTICAL_SPILT and HORIZONTAL_SPLIT stereo
	  modes.

2002-03-27 06:09  don

	* Update to makeefs/makerules

2002-03-27 00:55  don

	* update to makedefs.new makerules.new

2002-03-26 23:52  robert

	* Added support for osg::MemoryManager which is based upon Paul
	  Nettle's
	  memory manager published at flipcode.com. This can be turned on
	  with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses custom
	  global
	  new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew and osgDelete
	  macro's
	  which add ability to log line and file from which calls are made.
	  
	  Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and osgPlugins/osg to use
	  osgNew/osgDelete,
	  and fixed memory leaks highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26  don

	* Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

2002-03-26 21:24  don

	* Temporarily adding makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

2002-03-25 23:18  robert

	* Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager
	  published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's macro's for
	  new/delete etc, but use
	  osg prefixed versions instead to allow greater flexiblity in
	  handling include
	  ordering.
	  
	  Have fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result.
	  
	  To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line.
	  
	  Have yet to move the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this
	  next.

2002-03-25 23:13  robert

	* Added missing osgstereoimage.dsp

2002-03-25 19:04  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-03-23 21:30  robert

	* Fixed warning in DisplaySettings.cpp

2002-03-23 21:28  robert

	* Moved the exit on escape into Window, and added a virtual free
	  method on both
	  Window an Viewer to clean up the windows, this is now called
	  before exit is
	  finally called, ensure that more more memroy is clean up prior to
	  exit.

2002-03-23 10:55  robert

	* Added GL_TEXTURE_3D definition for those with gl.h headers which
	  don't
	  contain it.

2002-03-21 15:46  robert

	* Added missing TextureCubeMap.cpp to cvs.

2002-03-21 12:36  robert

	* Renamed have_applied_mode, have_applied_attribute, apply_mode,
	  apply_attribute
	  to haveAppliedMode, haveAppliedAttribute, applyMode,
	  applyAttribute to make
	  it more consistent with the general OSG name convetion.

2002-03-21 12:00  robert

	* Added osg:State:have_applied_mode(mode) and
	  have_applied_attribute(type) to make it
	  easier to specify which modes and attributes have been modified
	  without
	  the user requiring to know to what value, or to have an
	  equivilant attribute
	  to pass to the have_applied_attribute method. The original
	  have_applied(mode)
	  and have_applied(attribute) methods have been renamed
	  have_applied_mode(),
	  have_applied_attribute() as this was required to prevent the mode
	  and type
	  values colliding during compile (it was causing a compile error
	  when the method
	  names were the same.)

2002-03-21 11:57  robert

	* _cullMaskRight was not being initialized in the constructor which
	  was
	  resulting in some sporadic problems when running stereo -
	  occoasionally the
	  right eye view wouldn't appear!

2002-03-21 07:50  don

	* Modified files reflect small changes to work with Sun OS port....
	  
	  Removed redundant README file in osgviews... was a copy of
	  sgv/README.

2002-03-20 22:39  robert

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap which encapsulates OpenGL's cube
	  texture mapping.

2002-03-20 14:03  robert

	* Added a Referenced::unref_nodelete() method which unreferences
	  but does
	  not delete the object even if its count goes to 0 or below. This
	  should
	  only be called in special circumstances, the
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult
	  being one of them. This new method has allowed the problem of
	  objects
	  being multiple referenced on return from readNodeFile() &
	  readImageFile().

2002-03-20 11:24  robert

	* Updates to Texture and TextureCubeMap to clean up the code so
	  they share
	  much more of the core texture setup code. This largely invloved
	  paramterizing
	  the applyImmediateMode, which has also been rename applyTexImage
	  to reflect
	  its functionality better.

2002-03-20 11:22  robert

	* Added the fallback of intersecting with the a drawables bounding
	  box, if the drawable
	  isn't a GeoSet and hence supported by the IntersectVisitor's
	  GeoSet primitive
	  intersections code.

2002-03-18 23:10  robert

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap. submission from Brede Johansen.

2002-03-18 22:03  robert

	* Fixed the MS version number check in Optiizer.cpp. Fixes to
	  memory handling
	  in ReaderWriterDW.cpp. Submissions from Geoff Michel.

2002-03-18 21:56  don

	* Changes required for SUN Solaris port...

2002-03-17 18:44  robert

	* Added new osgstereoimage demo which loads two stero paired images
	  to create
	  a 3D via of photographed scene.

2002-03-14 23:19  robert

	* Fix of a delete char array so it used delete [].

2002-03-14 20:29  don

	* Fixed a problem for finding MIPS 64 bit libraries. Was seaching
	  for
	  LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY64_PATH

2002-03-14 17:34  robert

	* Integrated various changes worked on at the Glasgow Science
	  Center. Changes
	  include change the CameraManipulators so they work with double
	  for time
	  instead of float. Also added support for DataType to
	  osg::StateAttribute
	  and StateSet so that they can be set to either STATIC or DYNAMIC,
	  this
	  allows the optimizer to know whether that an attribute can be
	  optimized
	  or not.

2002-03-14 16:42  robert

	* Added a TextureCallback which cycles through various filter
	  modes, used
	  in testing new glTextParamters update functionality. I have
	  commented out
	  the call to attaching of the callback so osgtexture outwardly
	  behaves as
	  before. The code lies dormant just incase we need to use it for
	  testing
	  in the future.

2002-03-14 16:01  robert

	* Changed Texture so that is use lazy updating on texture paramters
	  (Filter/Wrap)
	  mode by using a _texParamtersDirty flag in combination with an
	  applyTexParamters(State&) method which does the paramters setting
	  in one
	  tidy bundle. This new implementations replaces the CompileFlags
	  submitted
	  yesterday.
	  
	  Simplified NodeCallback by remove osg::NodeCallback::Requirements
	  as they
	  are no longer needed.
	  
	  Fixed comments in Drawable.
	  
	  Put guards around cosf definations so that they are only used
	  under Win32/Mac.
	  
	  Fixed warning in CullVisitor.

2002-03-14 15:26  robert

	* Fix to handling of big/little endian in trpage_readbuf sent in by
	  Randall Hopper,
	  and a waning fix.

2002-03-14 00:07  don

	* Fixed compile flags in Texture

2002-03-13 22:44  don

	* Fixed DrawCallback in Drawable and added CullCallback to Drawable
	  Cull Visitor now checks for a Drawable's CullCallback and calls
	  it
	  if it exists. It then prunes based on the return value (bool) of
	  the
	  cull callback.

2002-03-09 10:54  robert

	* Support added for pivot points, submission from Mike Connel.

2002-03-09 10:53  robert

	* Fixed setWindowWidth call to account for width and height
	  correctly.

2002-03-09 10:52  robert

	* TXP plugin updates from Boris Bralo.

2002-03-09 10:52  robert

	* TXP plugin changes submitted by Boris Bralo.

2002-03-09 10:51  robert

	* TXP plugin update from Boris Bralo.

2002-03-04 01:37  robert

	* Added file extension guard to .obj reader plugin.

2002-03-03 22:31  robert

	* Added support for seperate traversal masks for standard, left and
	  right
	  cull traversals. This allows one to create seperate rendering for
	  left
	  and right eyes when doing stereo.

2002-03-02 09:24  robert

	* Added a GL vesion number check to LightModel, and small typo fix
	  in Registry.

2002-03-01 09:29  robert

	* Added getInverse implementation to AnimationPath, and added #if
	  guard
	  to Optimizer.cpp to all compilation on state optimizer when using
	  VS7.

2002-03-01 09:28  robert

	* Fixes to osgText to improve robustness when running multithreaded
	  multipipe
	  apps.

2002-03-01 09:27  robert

	* Updates to the clamp to border support in osg::Texture.

2002-02-28 00:11  robert

	* Added support for setting the maximum number of graphics contexts
	  that the
	  OSG has to maintian.

2002-02-27 22:12  robert

	* Added an using namespace osg to fix a MipsPro7.3 build error.

2002-02-27 22:04  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file with Boris' email address.

2002-02-27 22:00  robert

	  osg::Texture,
	  submitted by Sasa Bistrovic.

2002-02-27 21:57  robert

	* Fixes to DW loader, submitted by Geoff Michel.

2002-02-27 00:58  robert

	* Added new osg::AnimationPath which is contaner for a set of key
	  frames for
	  defining an animation path. To be used with osg::Transform etc.

2002-02-26 20:01  robert

	* Added makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) to Quat in prep for new
	  classes for
	  animation paths.

2002-02-25 23:14  robert

	* Added LightModel.cpp's to Codewarrior files and added
	  definiations for pre gl version 1.2 headers lack of support for
	  color control.

2002-02-25 22:46  robert

	* Added support for glLightModel functionality via osg::LightModel.

2002-02-24 23:03  robert

	* Updated docs, ChangLog and NEW for patched version of 0.8.44.

2002-02-24 22:39  robert

	* Added LineStipple to mcp file.

2002-02-24 20:55  robert

	* Added support for glLineStipple via osg::LineStipple state
	  attribute.

2002-02-24 20:21  robert

	* Removed Metrowerks.mcp as it has not been kept up to date since
	  October,
	  the new OpenSceneGraph.mcp replaces it.

2002-02-24 16:49  robert

	* Integrated fixes to the detailed depth calculation in the
	  CullVisitor from
	  Sasa, and fix to the IntersectVisitor's management of path from
	  Sean.

2002-02-23 00:16  robert

	* Updates to Windows Codwarrior file

2002-02-22 23:40  robert

	* updates for Win32 Codewarrior build

2002-02-22 23:39  robert

	* Fix for win32 Codewarrior build

2002-02-22 17:12  robert

	* Add support for Metrowerks Codewarrior build under Windows.

2002-02-19 18:59  robert

	* fixed txp build name problem - was overwriting .osg plugin.

2002-02-18 23:01  robert

	* Fixed stereo implementation.

2002-02-18 21:52  robert

	* Fixes to Win32 build of new DX writer plugin.

2002-02-18 20:48  robert

	* Comment w.r.t OpenDX plugin updated.

2002-02-18 20:46  robert

	* Added OpenDX writer from Randall Hopper.

2002-02-14 13:26  robert

	* Beginings of reimplementation of stereo support in scene view.
	  Work
	  not complete yet.

2002-02-14 12:55  robert

	* updated the options for the txp plugin.

2002-02-14 12:51  robert

	* Removed osgWX workspace files.

2002-02-14 11:06  robert

	* Fixed impostor bug introduced when new modelview matrix was moved
	  entirely
	  within the cull traversal/draw traversal. The impostor code has
	  been adapted
	  to the new convention.

2002-02-13 22:56  robert

	* Updated the makefiles to all have the #!gmake reference to force
	  IRIX
	  compilation using gmake rather than pmake or smake. This gets
	  round
	  issues with exporting OSGHOME.

2002-02-13 22:53  robert

	* Updated the osgconv support for orientation conversion so that it
	  used
	  inserted a static transform to do the work of rotating the scene,
	  then
	  applied a standard
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformsVisitor
	  traversal to flatten the transfrom down on to the geometry nodes.

2002-02-13 22:52  robert

	* Fixed the fabsf define which was eroneous mapped to sqrtf, due to
	  the copy and
	  paste antipattern no doubt.

2002-02-13 00:13  robert

	* Fixed problems with intersection visitor coupled with the viewer.

2002-02-13 00:00  robert

	* Added sgv -stereo cessna.osg to make test list.

2002-02-12 23:49  robert

	* Added a set of test runs to the makefiles and demos. The demos
	  now have
	  titles relevenat to their function.

2002-02-12 22:51  robert

	* Updates for IRIX build, and docs updates.

2002-02-12 22:35  robert

	* Removed references to osgWX from the doc++ directory.

2002-02-12 08:23  robert

	* Updates to Transform and CullVistor to support new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix methods.

2002-02-11 23:24  robert

	* Updates to Transform handling in CullVisitor, in prep for moving
	  camera
	  modelview and projection into Transform nodes.

2002-02-11 22:53  robert

	* Clean up of TXP plugin for IRIX build.

2002-02-11 19:51  robert

	* Cleand up the root Makefile.
	  
	  Moved CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to
	  managing lights
	  entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the management
	  of modelview
	  matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores the absolute modelview
	  matrix, rather
	  than a model matrix as done previously. The later allows
	  RenderLeaf's to do
	  a glLoadMatrix rather than a
	  glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

2002-02-11 15:09  robert

	* Fixed Linux hang of the TXP loader by overriding the default -O2
	  optimization
	  level which appears to cause the code to hang, -O works fine for
	  some strange
	  reason, I havn't found any direct problems in the code. This may
	  be compiler
	  bug or a code bug, the bug may go away in later versions of
	  GNUC++, the
	  problem currently occurs under GCC2.96.

2002-02-11 12:51  robert

	* Applied fix to transparancy in flt loader.

2002-02-11 03:26  robert

	* Fixed the date on the release.

2002-02-11 02:38  robert

	* Updated changelog for release.

2002-02-11 02:34  robert

	* Fixed a make install error on the plugins related to the old
	  definitions for
	  plugin names hanging around despite being deprecated. These
	  definiations
	  confused the make install/make instclean so it tried to link a
	  non existant
	  library. Have removed old definitions and everything intalls
	  properly once
	  more:-)

2002-02-11 01:02  robert

	* Updated changelog.

2002-02-11 00:51  robert

	* Did a make docs, in prep for the 0.8.44 release.

2002-02-11 00:42  robert

	* Added missing doc++ generated .html files.

2002-02-11 00:40  robert

	* Updated Stats code, sent in by Geof Michel.

2002-02-11 00:23  robert

	* Clean up INSTALL notes.

2002-02-10 23:19  robert

	* Updateds NEWS for the 0.8.44 release.
	  
	  Change the osg::NodeVisitor::getLocalToWorldMatrix() /
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix() methods so it do not initilize the matrix
	  being
	  passed to them, and assume the the users has already initiliazed
	  them
	  appropriately, such as to take account of camera positions.

2002-02-10 22:35  robert

	* Implemented NodeVisitor's getLocalToWorldMatrix and
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix
	  to allow users to querry the current accumulated matrix state
	  within the
	  scene graph.

2002-02-10 20:05  robert

	* Disbalbed a dumb warning in Windows build via a #pragma.

2002-02-10 17:16  robert

	* Fixed a bug in the drive manipulator which was due to it using
	  the local
	  coords of the intersection point with the scene rather than the
	  world
	  coord value for that point. The code now uses
	  osgUtil::Hit::getWorldIntersectionPoint() method for getting the
	  world coords.
	  
	  Added support for getWorldIntersectionPoint to Viewer.cpp.
	  
	  Put and #ifdef around the setting of the default display list
	  visitor so
	  it nolonger sets in under IRIX. This is a world around to the IR
	  graphics
	  imbending lighting info into display lists, if the display lists
	  are
	  created before state is set up it produces lighting artifacts
	  such as
	  flickering. Remove the the default display list init visitor
	  removes
	  these problems, display lists are then built on the fly and
	  drawables
	  a drawn for the first time.

2002-02-10 11:17  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-02-10 10:42  robert

	* Fixes to TXP loader for Cygwin and Ming builds.

2002-02-09 22:29  robert

	* Fixed the osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformVisitor so
	  that it
	  does not flatten drawables which have double references to them,
	  but only
	  one reference with a static transform on it. This case can't be
	  flattened
	  but this wasn't picked up. The code now detects the case
	  correctly.

2002-02-09 21:29  robert

	* Updates to BMP loader from Geoff Michel.

2002-02-09 19:46  robert

	* Added std:: infront of string refrences to solve compile problems
	  under gcc 3.0.3.
	  
	  Also converted to unix file endings so other the windows style
	  files.

2002-02-09 14:29  robert

	* Updates to docs and fixes to a few warnings.

2002-02-09 10:54  robert

	* Updated docs.

2002-02-09 10:50  robert

	* Fix to BMP loader.

2002-02-09 10:24  robert

	* Fixes for cygwin and mingw builds.

2002-02-08 23:07  robert

	* Removed further wxsgv files.

2002-02-08 23:04  robert

	* Removed osgWX and wxsgv from the repositry as it is intend to
	  keep the core
	  distribution clean from GUI examples, these instead should live
	  in the bazaar.
	  This can better accomodate the many different types of viewer
	  that users are
	  developming.

2002-02-08 22:55  robert

	* Added support for parents to Drawables.
	  
	  Bumped up version numbers in prep for 0.8.44.

2002-02-08 09:30  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX and Boris Bralo's TerraPage loader.

2002-02-07 08:07  robert

	* Fixed teh setDrawCallback so that it now calls dirtyDisplayList()
	  instead of
	  dirtyBound.

2002-02-07 01:17  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-02-07 01:15  robert

	* Various investigations into culling errors w.r.t matrix inversion
	  resulted in
	  the conclusion that the osg::Matrix::inverse was broken, have
	  lifted a new
	  implementation from sgl and it seems to work fine. Will need
	  further testing
	  but looks good.

2002-02-07 01:12  robert

	* Fix for the handling of lighting in the DW loader.

2002-02-07 01:11  robert

	* Added a check to the destructor of Referenced so that it detects
	  referenced
	  objects that are deleted whilest still having a positive
	  _refCount, such
	  as when a object has been deleted on the stack, yet other
	  references still
	  exist for it. Have put the desctructor implementation in
	  Object.cpp to
	  avoid adding yet another file with only a couple of lines of code
	  in.

2002-02-07 01:07  robert

	* Added callbacks to allow users to modify the underlying
	  functionality of
	  LOD, Billboard and Drawabel objects.

2002-02-07 01:05  robert

	* Added extensions code submitted by Yefrei.

2002-02-06 08:57  robert

	* Compile fixes.

2002-02-05 21:54  robert

	* Have taken a few more steps towards support for view dependant
	  transformations
	  by adding a ComputeTransformCallback to osg::Transform, and have
	  now removed
	  the recently added AutoTransform since it is nolonger required.
	  Have also
	  updated CullVisitor to account for the new ways for tracking
	  transformation
	  matrices in the scene.

2002-02-05 21:51  robert

	* Have removed the old lazy initialization of Matrix since it was
	  causing bugs
	  and adding checks to many mothods which in the end slow it down
	  more than
	  not intilizing the code! The code is now simpler, more robust and
	  faster:-)

2002-02-05 10:49  robert

	* Added comment to flt2osg's handling of osg::Material setup w.r.t
	  osg::Material::_colorMode.

2002-02-03 22:32  don

	* added shademodel to TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES

2002-02-03 20:57  robert

	* Added beginings of new AutoTransform class.

2002-02-03 19:18  robert

	* Fixes for GCC 3.0.3 build.

2002-02-03 12:33  robert

	* Removed the trailing ; after namespace {...} declariations in
	  headers
	  which was being picked as a warning under Codewarrior.

2002-02-03 11:38  robert

	* Added first cut at new AutoTransform node which will be used for
	  generating
	  Transform's during the cull traversal such as for earth/sky etc.

2002-02-03 11:35  robert

	* Updates for Borland compilation.

2002-02-02 20:07  robert

	* Added defined( __BCPLUSPLUS__) to windows export code segments.

2002-02-02 19:49  robert

	* Fixed a copy and paste error which was causing compile problems
	  under Windows,
	  due to a incorrect comparison of objects of different types.

2002-02-02 10:52  robert

	* Typo fixed in the header guard.

2002-01-30 19:59  robert

	* Fixed clone(CopyOp&) and cloneType() methods which were out of
	  sync with the
	  new style clone operations.

2002-01-30 18:59  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build

2002-01-30 16:24  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build.

2002-01-30 15:27  robert

	* Removed the M_PI defines from include/osg/Math and have use a
	  const double osg::PI etc
	  in its place.

2002-01-30 15:02  robert

	* Changes for Borland C++ compiler changes.

2002-01-30 15:02  robert

	* Added osgbillboard project files to the VisualStudio workspace.

2002-01-30 15:01  robert

	* Added osgbillboard demo. The code is main a copy of osgtexture
	  right now,
	  my plan to do change it to make it a better demo of the different
	  types
	  of billboard that one can do.

2002-01-30 14:37  robert

	* Removed a Makedepend that didn't belong!

2002-01-30 13:15  robert

	* Fixed the rotation direction of the POINT_ROT_* modes, this was
	  broken by
	  earlier fixes to the osg::Matrix.

2002-01-30 12:09  robert

	* Made the LineSegment destructor protected to force users to
	  create segments
	  on the stack thus ensure that they arn't created locally and have
	  their
	  memory deleted incorrectly.
	  
	  Also updated the IntersectVisitor so that it no used
	  osg::ref_ptr<> internally
	  for storing all data. Have also move the IntersectState helper
	  class to inside the
	  IntersectVisitor which simplifies the external interface to the
	  class.

2002-01-29 20:25  robert

	* Fixes for windows build.

2002-01-29 14:20  robert

	* Removed the now rendundent DeepCopy and ShallowCopy files.

2002-01-29 14:04  robert

	* Moved all references to osg::Cloner to osg::CopyOp.

2002-01-29 12:55  robert

	* Fixed the header guard, which was using the name define as
	  FileUtils.
	  Problem spotted by Terry Welsh.

2002-01-29 12:52  robert

	* Have add new osg::CopyOp which replaces last nights osg::Cloner,
	  the new
	  class now combines Cloner and DeepCopy into one class. Cloner and
	  DeepCopy
	  will be removed in next commit.
	  
	  Also have added osgcopy app to Demos which shows how the CopyOp
	  have be
	  subclassed to create users own specific handling of copying.
	  
	  Have fixed copy constructor problems in GeoSet which fix the deep
	  copy
	  problem experienced yesterday.

2002-01-28 21:49  robert

	* A couple of fixes to DeepCopy Cloner.

2002-01-28 21:17  robert

	* Added support for shallow and deep copy of nodes, drawables and
	  state, via a
	  copy constructor which takes an optional Cloner object, and the
	  old
	  osg::Object::clone() has changed so that it now requires a Cloner
	  as paramter.
	  This is passed on to the copy constructor to help control the
	  shallow vs
	  deep copying. The old functionality of clone() which was clone of
	  type has
	  been renamed to cloneType().
	  
	  Updated all of the OSG to work with these new conventions,
	  implemention all
	  the required copy constructors etc. A couple of areas will do
	  shallow
	  copies by design, a couple of other still need to be updated to
	  do either
	  shallow or deep.
	  
	  Neither of the shallow or deep copy operations have been tested
	  yet, only
	  the old functionality of the OSG has been checked so far, such
	  running the
	  viewer on various demo datasets.
	  
	  Also fixed a problem in
	  osg::Optimize::RemoveRendundentNodesVisitor which
	  was not checking that Group didn't have have any attached
	  StateSet's, Callbacks
	  or UserData. These checks have now been added, which fixes a bug
	  which was
	  revealled by the new osgscribe demo, this related to removal of
	  group acting
	  as state decorator.
	  
	  method

2002-01-27 20:28  robert

	* Added
	  stateset->setMode(GL_LIGHTING,osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE_ON);
	  to scribbed
	  subgraph so that lighting is always on, this is needed since
	  glMaterial is only
	  active when lighting is enabled.

2002-01-26 20:03  robert

	* Added VisualStudio workspace files for new osgscribe demo.

2002-01-26 19:48  robert

	* Added new osgscribe demo which demostrates how to create a
	  wireframe
	  overlay of a model.

2002-01-26 14:13  robert

	* Fixed the LOD center and range code that so that the values are
	  now multiple
	  by the _unitScale to compenstate for different scales in the flt
	  model. This
	  _unitScale had already been applied to the geometry data.
	  
	  Integrated new defaults for the texturing wrap mode, for when now
	  .attr file
	  is supplied with a flt file.

2002-01-23 22:15  robert

	* Have made osg::Transform more extensible via additions of new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix()
	  and getWorldToLocalMatrix(), computeLocalToWorld() and
	  computeWorldToLocal()
	  methods.
	  
	  Have updated the CullVisitor, IntersectVisitor and Optimizer to
	  use the
	  new osg::Transform::getLocalToWorldMatrix() which has the same
	  functionality
	  as the old getMatrix() but is now supports subclasses of
	  osg::Transform
	  transparently.
	  
	  Have added osg::PositionAttitudeTransform as subclass of
	  osg::Transform
	  which manages the transform as position and attitude via a Vec3
	  and Quat
	  respectively.

2002-01-23 15:42  robert

	* Updates to osg::Transform to allow it subclassed more easily.

2002-01-23 15:28  robert

	* Fixed problem with Optimzer::removeRedundentNodesVisitor which
	  was removing the
	  correct redundent groups but for groups which had a single child
	  it was
	  was not using replaceChild to rettach the child to its parents.
	  It was using
	  parent->removeChild(group)...parent->addChild(child); which was
	  allow the child
	  to be attached in a different place than the original group, this
	  broke LOD code.
	  Have used removeChild instead which solves the LOD problem.

2002-01-23 12:04  robert

	* Changed the ordering of applying OpenGL modes and attributes back
	  to the original
	  modes first then attributes since the it was cause a display bug
	  on some
	  datesets. It seems that the modes needs enabling before
	  glMaterial's
	  take affect, at least on the NVidia drivers under Windows and
	  Linux.
	  The OpenGL reference guide doesn't mention any dependancy so I'm
	  not
	  sure what the official line is. Some other OpenGl attribute and
	  modes
	  need to be applied in that order according to the blue book,
	  however,
	  drivers, at least the NVidia drivers seem require the opposite.
	  This may raise
	  the spectra of before and after mode applies, but this will
	  require extra
	  support in osg::State and osg::StateAttribute, and would have to
	  be handled
	  on a per attribute basis, and possibly different of each
	  platform. Yuck.

2002-01-22 19:30  robert

	* Fixed FlattenStaticTransformVisitor bug which related to
	  incorrect handling
	  of objects which were transformed by multiple matrices at one
	  time - this
	  cannot be handled in the flattening process (since we only have
	  one piece
	  of geometry to transform). This visitor now handles this case by
	  disabling
	  flattening of any objects and transforms associated in this way.

2002-01-22 12:03  robert

	* Temporily commented out the call to the
	  FlatternStaticTransformVisitor to
	  prevent a bug in handling instance nodes. Will be commented back
	  in once the
	  bug has been solved.

2002-01-22 11:03  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file to reflect recent submission.

2002-01-22 11:03  robert

	* Added support for node instances to Open Flight loader. Submitted
	  by Yefei He.

2002-01-20 19:30  robert

	* Fixes to Windows compile.

2002-01-20 16:24  robert

	* Updates to help compilation under gcc 3.03.

2002-01-19 22:11  robert

	* Converted osgUtil::GUIEventAdapter::MouseButtonMask from
	  LEFT_BUTTON etc to
	  LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON etc, to prevent classes with #define of
	  LEFT_BUTTON.. when
	  including certain MS Windows headers. Arhsh Snarfff..

2002-01-19 20:34  robert

	* Fixed the handling of non transparent billboards, since it was
	  not taking into
	  account any accumulated transforms inherited from above.

2002-01-18 22:36  robert

	* UPdates to CullVisitor so that it keeps in sync with the new
	  method paramter
	  change in osg::Billboard.
	  
	  Removed in instance of an object being passed () brackets, have
	  removed the
	  brackets to avoid an amiguity with the compiler intepreting it as
	  a function.

2002-01-18 22:34  robert

	* Changes to fix compilation problems on the Sparc.
	  
	  GeoSet.cpp simply remove rendundent code that had already been
	  commented out.

2002-01-18 22:25  robert

	* Added support for multiple graphics contexts, submission from Max
	  Rhiener.
	  
	  Alas changed the indenting to use 4 spaces instead of tabs, this
	  irons out
	  differences when working under Windows and Unix, keeping the
	  identing
	  consistent.

2002-01-18 22:15  robert

	* First steps to updating the calcTransform function in Billboard
	  to fix
	  z axis contraint on rotation axis.

2002-01-18 19:00  robert

	* Fixed copy constructor which was copying a matrix to unitialized
	  memory.

2002-01-18 14:12  robert

	* Removed the global scope operators for the isnan(..) etc calls to
	  fix compilation
	  under some compiler combinations.

2002-01-18 14:11  robert

	* Made the osg::Timer::tick() method a const method.

2002-01-18 10:26  robert

	* Fixed typo in comment, reference to BoundingSphere has been
	  changed to
	  BoundingBox. Typo spotted by Gial Paolo Lorenzetto.

2002-01-17 22:41  robert

	* Fixed ENALBE_ALL_CULLING spelling mistake, have changed it to
	  ENABLE_ALL_CULLING.

2002-01-17 22:40  robert

	* Added support for glutSpecialFunc, glutSpaceballMotion,
	  glutSpaceballRotate and
	  glutSpaceballRotate into osgGLUT::Window base class.

2002-01-16 21:23  robert

	* Reversed the ordering of setting of OpenGL modes and attributes,
	  so that
	  attributes are now set first, then modes. This is keep consistent
	  with
	  the setting of glColorMaterial and glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL) as
	  specfied
	  in OpenGL documentation.

2002-01-16 21:22  robert

	* Changed the enum Types { ... } so that in no longer explicitly
	  sets the values,
	  leaving C++ to ensire that values are unque and insequence.

2002-01-16 21:20  robert

	* Fixes to makefiles which have become a bit unhinged after MacOS X
	  integration.

2002-01-16 21:12  robert

	* Added support for billboard in OpenFlight loader. Submission from
	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-01-16 12:29  robert

	* Submission from Sean Spicer which adds Make/makedefs.irix.std.64
	  which
	  compiles the OSG as 64bit. Small changes by Robert to accomodate
	  recent MacOSX makefile changes.

2002-01-16 12:08  robert

	* Changes to Make/makerules.* and Make/makedefs.* to accomodate
	  MacOSX's need
	  to treat plugins and shared libraries seperately.

2002-01-16 12:05  robert

	* Integrated the changes to osgPlugin/Makefile's for MacOSX port.

2002-01-16 12:03  robert

	* Changed hardwired char[1024] arrays to
	  char[FILEUTILS_MAX_PATH_LENGTH] and
	  defined the value to be 2048, this should avoid problems with
	  path lengths
	  which have been overflowing the 1024 limit (Sasa report this
	  bug). The
	  real solution is to use std::string throught FileUtils, but this
	  will have
	  to wait for another day.

2002-01-16 10:41  robert

	* Added quicktime plugin (for Mac's only), submitted by Phil Atkin.

2002-01-16 10:36  robert

	* First batch of changes required for MacOS X build. Orignal
	  submission from
	  Phil Atkin, merged by Robert Osfield.

2002-01-15 23:21  robert

	* Changed the use of std::vector<..>.begin() to &vector<..>.front()
	  in code
	  from passing the vector contents to the
	  GeoSet::setPrimLengths(..) etc.
	  methods. This has been done to fix the compile under the MS .NET
	  compiler
	  which has changed the definiation of the
	  std::vector<..>::iterator to
	  a class rather than a pointer.

2002-01-15 19:54  robert

	* Fix to osgDB::getStrippedName(..) so that handles the case of
	  file without
	  an extension.

2002-01-15 15:49  robert

	* Added '# LIBS += -limage' and explanation in comments to pfb
	  Makefile,
	  submitted by Randall Hooper.

2002-01-15 12:13  robert

	* Added the set of GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S and _T to code converting
	  pfTexGen to
	  osg::TexGen. This is try and fix a bug in handling tex gen
	  datasets such
	  as sj_texgen.pfb.

2002-01-15 11:05  robert

	* New ajustAspectRatio (ADJUST_NODE) mode added to osg::Camera to
	  fix issue
	  with integration with vrjuggler, submitted by Allen Bierbaum.

2002-01-12 21:49  robert

	* Missing _attachedTransformMode in osg::Camera constructor, fix
	  submitted by
	  Ben Discoe.

2002-01-05 16:19  robert

	* Change TOP to OSGHOME in makefiles.

2002-01-05 16:18  robert

	* Moved the setting of camera fusion distance mode into the handle
	  method so that
	  it is updated on everyframe to ensure that switching between
	  Drive/Flight
	  and Trackball happens seemlessly.

2002-01-04 20:44  robert

	* Renamed the TOP variable in the Makefiles to OSGHOME.

2002-01-04 20:43  robert

	* Added a guard to osg::LOD::evaluate so that it returns -1 if the
	  range
	  matched does not have a corresponding child to relate to. This
	  can happen
	  if a user creates more than n+1 ranges, where n is the number of
	  LOD children.

2002-01-04 17:35  robert

	* Added osg::ShadeModel state attribute which encapsulates
	  glShadeModel.

2002-01-04 17:34  robert

	* Fixed a bug in writing of line strips and line loops to the .osg
	  file.

2002-01-04 13:14  robert

	* Fixed multiple deletion of shared indecies in GeoSet destructor.

2002-01-03 23:28  robert

	* Futher Makefile updates for Cygwin support - from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 23:19  robert

	* Makefile changes to support Cywin port - submission from Norman
	  Vine, updates
	  to fix case problems under unix by Robert.

2002-01-03 21:34  robert

	* Updates for Cygwin port, from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 19:28  robert

	* Small source code changes for Cygwin port of OSG.

2002-01-02 17:01  robert

	* Updates in preperation for the third attempt at the 0.8.43
	  release.

2002-01-02 15:42  robert

	* Updates from Randall Hopper to fix build under IRIX.

2002-01-02 11:03  robert

	* A small bug fix to the matrix dump function (it was primtiing out
	  5 columns
	  instead of four).
	  
	  Added support for multiplying mesh geometry by the matrix
	  attached to the
	  Lib3dsMesh structure, however this produces disjointed models so
	  have
	  to the default mode to bypass this multiplication code. Will need
	  to revisit
	  this in the future.

2002-01-02 10:59  robert

	* Commented out the smoothing of FLAT_TRIANGLE_STRIP and
	  FLAT_TRIANGLE_FAN
	  since it was causes problems with any color list which were
	  attached.

2002-01-02 10:53  robert

	* Moved the glShadeModel(FLAT/SMOOTH) outside of the primtitive
	  inner loop to reduce
	  the amount state changes incurred when using FLAT_ primtives.

2002-01-02 10:49  robert

	* Fixed the orientation of for_each_triangle cases for QUAD and
	  QUAD_STRIP.

2001-12-31 23:21  robert

	* Removed the variables which were duplicated in osgGLUT::Viewer
	  and
	  osgGLUT::Window, standardising on the Window ones, and therefore
	  removing
	  an unitialized variable that had been introduced. This caused a
	  crash
	  under WindowsXP due to send invalid values to glutReshapeWindow.

2001-12-31 23:16  robert

	* Added a more detailed explanation of how LOD's work.

2001-12-31 00:04  robert

	* Updates to NEWS for date of release, and added
	  include/osg/DisplaySettings
	  and include/osg/LineWidth to the src/osg/Makefile.

2001-12-30 20:48  robert

	* Final update of ChangeLog for the 0.8.43 release.

2001-12-30 20:03  robert

	* Added osg::GeoSet::FLAT_TRIANGLE_FAN to the list if primitive
	  handled by the
	  for_each_triangle template function.

2001-12-30 19:04  robert

	* Added /usr/local/lib to the s_default_dso_path search path for
	  plugins.

2001-12-30 17:13  robert

	* Made the output message related to not registering a camera
	  manipulator
	  with the GLUT Viewer output as INFO rather than as a NOTICE. This
	  suppress
	  this message which was appearing on some of the demos all the
	  time, even
	  though are quite reasonable default behaviour is used.

2001-12-30 16:59  robert

	* Added references to sgv -stereo and sgv -stencil to the notes of
	  running
	  the demos.

2001-12-30 16:58  robert

	* Updated the default home position of so that a better view of the
	  scene is seen.

2001-12-30 15:24  robert

	* Moved the old by hand ChangeLog to ChangeLog.preCVS and then ran
	  cvs2cl.pl
	  to automatically generate the new ChangeLog.

2001-12-30 15:12  robert

	* Did a make docs, in preperation for 0.8.43 release.

2001-12-30 15:01  robert

	* Compilation fix to pfb plugin, sent in by Ulrich Hertlein.

2001-12-30 15:00  robert

	* Added a comment in Windows section on INSTALL notes such that it
	  now
	  recommends that you build all the libs.

2001-12-29 20:53  robert

	* Added .README to prevent CVS from deleting the empty bin
	  directory when checking
	  out copies. This was a problem with the nightly tarballs.

2001-12-29 14:27  robert

	* Added comment to osg::Transform w.r.t use of GL_NORMALIZE when
	  using
	  scaling Transforms.

2001-12-29 12:28  robert

	* Updates form Randall Hopper for the FreeBSD build

2001-12-27 20:06  robert

	* Made inline documentation on the Values enum clearer w.r.t the
	  function of
	  OVERRIDE_ON and OVERRIDE_OFF.

2001-12-26 20:55  robert

	* Added more details about using stereo with the OSG, in particular
	  the
	  role of the camera manipulators and the fusion distance.

2001-12-24 23:34  robert

	* Updated doc++ references so that CVS knows about all the newly
	  generated
	  files.

2001-12-24 23:28  robert

	* Updated the index.html to include references to the new osgText
	  library and
	  demo app.

2001-12-24 23:14  robert

	* Removed references to redundent environmental variables.

2001-12-24 21:56  robert

	* Did a make docs.

2001-12-24 21:34  robert

	* Fixed the osg::Light so that it requires the user to explicitly
	  define which
	  OpenGL light is being operated on, and also now relies upong the
	  standard
	  osg::State handling of OpenGL modes to switch on the appropriate
	  lights.
	  
	  The previous static counter mechansim for the light number was
	  causing a
	  redundent light to be created when the osg plugin created the
	  first osg::Light
	  to use a prototype for other osg::Light's to be cloned from in
	  the
	  .osg plugin execution.
	  
	  The static count mechanism also prevent the lights modes being
	  controlled
	  independantly from the setting of the light paramters themselves.
	  This
	  meant that a light once created was global, and couldn't be
	  turned off
	  locally via the OSG's support for OpenGL mode enabling/disabling.
	  This
	  has been overcome with the new implementation, the user has
	  complete
	  flexiblity of when and where to use the different lights at their
	  disposal.

2001-12-24 19:06  robert

	* Updated the osgGLUT::Viewer to subclass from osgGLUT::Window as
	  has been
	  intended since the development of osgGLUT::Window.

2001-12-24 15:12  robert

	* updates for windows build

2001-12-24 14:12  robert

	* Various clean ups for the release.

2001-12-22 22:30  robert

	* Updates to keep things compiling under Windows. Also cleaned up
	  the new stereo.html docs.

2001-12-22 21:35  robert

	* Added beginnings on documentation for stereo support, the
	  stereo.html needs
	  to be re-edited in a html editor before it becomes readable
	  though..

2001-12-22 14:55  robert

	* Updated usage messages to include new stereo and stencil
	  commandline options.

2001-12-21 22:48  robert

	* Further work on improving stereo support in the OSG.
	  
	  Renamed the osg::VisualsSettings to osg::DisplaySettings, and
	  osgUtil::VisualsRequirementsVisitor to
	  osgUtil::DisplayRequirementsVisitor.
	  
	  Added support for OSG_SCREEN_HEIGHT into osg::DisplaySettings,
	  and added
	  a DisplaySettings* to the constructors of osg::SceneView and
	  osg::Camera.

2001-12-21 13:07  robert

	* Updates to the support for stereo in osg::Camera,
	  osgUtil::SceneView and
	  the CameraManipulators.

2001-12-20 20:48  robert

	* Added support for glLineWidth via an osg::LineWidth
	  StateAttribute.

2001-12-20 16:35  robert

	* Updates to the camera code related to stereo, adding fusion
	  distance.

2001-12-20 16:34  robert

	* Added check for null models be returned form
	  osgDB::readNodeFiles(..) to
	  prevent execution when no models have been loaded.

2001-12-20 12:12  robert

	* Updates to flt loading of light points, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-19 15:20  robert

	* Updates to Stereo code.

2001-12-19 10:29  robert

	* Updated the demos to support the new commandline handling of
	  stereo and
	  convinience functios for loading libs and files.

2001-12-19 08:49  robert

	* Added check for GL_ARB_imaging extension to osg;:ColorMatrix

2001-12-19 01:10  robert

	* Compilation fixes under for Windows

2001-12-19 00:38  robert

	* Adding support for controlling visual settings via environmental
	  variables
	  and command line paramters. Including support for stereo and
	  stencil buffer.

2001-12-18 11:28  robert

	* Added range checking to osg::Camera::adjustAspectRatio to catch
	  invalid values being
	  passed to Camera. Invalid values were occuring when iconising the
	  Windows GLUT
	  based OSG demos.

2001-12-18 10:46  robert

	* Fixed compilation problems in flt plugin under Windows, and
	  removed usage of
	  the default GeoSet::AtttributeDeleteFunctor from the DynGeoSet
	  since it handled
	  the memory deletion iteself via STL containers.

2001-12-17 21:13  robert

	* Changed the default field of Y to 45 degrees, as this is probably
	  a better
	  default than 30 degrees (what it was temproarily) or the 90
	  degrees that
	  it was originally.

2001-12-17 17:34  don

	* Fixed IRIX compile issues with the flt loader.
	  
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp had a variable "mips" defined, which is
	  predefined for the IRIX preprocessor.
	  Changed this to _mips.
	  
	  FltFile.cpp had a class and transient variable defined within the
	  scope of member function
	  FltFile::readExternals(), which was causing the IRIX 7.3 compiles
	  to hork. Moved the class
	  definition to outside of the member function scope.

2001-12-17 16:21  don

	* Fixed IRIX build. Required some namespace fixes and include and
	  link
	  directives in the Makefiles

2001-12-17 15:05  robert

	* Updated the Optimzer::FatternStaticTransform visit so by default
	  it ignores
	  all dynamic transforms, previously it flattened dynamic
	  transforms as well.

2001-12-17 09:29  robert

	* Added std:: infront of endl to ensure compilation under Windows.

2001-12-16 22:20  robert

	* Integrated detailed near clipping plane calculation into
	  osgUtil::CullVisitor,
	  submitted by Sasa Bistroviae.

2001-12-16 16:30  robert

	* From John Davis, a little addition to the Windows version of the
	  osg::Timer
	  constructor such that a static variable is used to force the
	  constructor
	  to check the number of clock cycles per second once, this means
	  that
	  multiple timers can now be created with incurring a the 1 second
	  delay
	  used for timming the clock speed every time the constructor is
	  called.

2001-12-15 22:44  robert

	* Updated version numbers to 0.8.43 in prep for the impending
	  release.

	* Added comments on how to set up STLport under Windows and IRIX.

2001-12-15 16:56  robert

	* Renamed osg::Matric::makeIdent() to osg::Matrix::makeIdentity()
	  to make
	  it consistent with the rest of the osg::Matrix naming. Updated
	  OSG
	  distribution to account for new name.
	  
	  Added support for the STATIC/DYNAMIC osg::Transform::Type to the
	  .osg
	  ASCII reader/writer plugin and the flt reader plugin.
	  
	  Removed the non cost version of osg::Transform::getMatrix() as
	  this could
	  by pass the dirty mechinism.

2001-12-15 10:00  robert

	* updates for windows build.

2001-12-14 23:18  robert

	* Fixes to Windows build in liu of the move to using just
	  std::streams.

2001-12-14 21:49  robert

	* Updated OSG so that the old OSG_USE_IO_DOT_H has be removed from
	  all headers
	  that used it, all references to the Standard C++ stream classes
	  use the
	  std::ostream etc convention, all references to "using namespace
	  std" and
	  "using namespace std::ostream etc" have been removed.

2001-12-14 18:06  robert

	* Updatedwidley used includes to remove most of the float/double
	  warnings
	  generated when compiling under Windows with STLport.

2001-12-14 16:15  robert

	* Don haved accidentally removed the reference to osg.dsp from the
	  .dsw file,
	  breakin the Windows build.

2001-12-14 15:37  don

	* Removed ^M from Makefile

2001-12-14 15:16  don

	* Appeased poor MS VisualStudio by adding the ^M's to all .dsw and
	  .dsp files.

2001-12-14 15:10  don

	* Fixed newline/cr problem

2001-12-14 14:25  robert

	* Fixed problem with incorrect combining of some LOD's derived from
	  flt databases.
	  Problem related to the order of the removal of redudent groups
	  and LOD combining,
	  the LOD combining only working properly if done first.

2001-12-14 10:47  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build related to changes in using namespace std.

2001-12-14 10:02  robert

	* Removed all references to using namespace std to help solve
	  compilation problems
	  under Windows and IRIX.
	  
	  Also integrated small change to lib3ds from Drew for IRIX
	  compilation.

2001-12-12 20:29  robert

	* Made the following name changes to Matrix and Quat to clean them
	  up and make
	  the functionality clear given the name. This will break user code
	  unfortunately
	  so please be away of the following mapping.
	  
	  osg::Matrix::makeTrans(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::makeTranslate(..)
	  osg::Matrix::makeRot(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::makeRotate(..)
	  osg::Matrix::trans(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::translate(..)
	  
	  osg::Quat::makeRot(..)?\026 -> osg::Quat::makeRotate(..)
	  
	  Also updated the rest of the OSG distribution to use the new
	  names, and
	  have removed the old deprecated Matrix methods too.

2001-12-12 15:09  robert

	* Fixed problems with osg::Matrix::makeRot(from,to) and
	  osg::Quat::makeRot(from,to)
	  so that they both use the same implementation (the Quat code now)
	  and the
	  code has been corrected to work from and to vectors which
	  directly opposite
	  to one another.

2001-12-12 12:55  robert

	* Fixed problem with loading interleaved arrays in the .osg loader,
	  and corrected
	  a spelling mistake in osg::GeoSet.

2001-12-12 05:09  don

	* Added translation and scaling to osgconv

2001-12-11 17:00  don

	* Fixed Matrix::rotate( Vec3 from, Vec3 to); was using to X from to
	  derive
	  axis, which causes a left-handed rotation. Fixed to from X to.

2001-12-11 16:00  robert

	* Fixed compilation problems under Windows due to changes in using
	  std::ostream etc.

2001-12-11 11:22  robert

	* Removed the 'using namespace std' and replaced with more specific
	  'using std::ostream'
	  this should help prevent polution of the global namespace with
	  std when including
	  these osg include files.

2001-12-11 11:21  robert

	* Added :Referenced() to the osg::Camera(..) copy constructor to
	  prevent a warning
	  under Linux.

2001-12-09 03:46  don

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-12-04 22:57  robert

	* Added support for automatic deletion of osg::GeoSet's attributes,
	  via a
	  default AttributeDeleteFunctor which uses delete []. Users can
	  create
	  their own handlers for the attribute memory to override this
	  default
	  behavior.
	  
	  Fixed a typo in ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp.

2001-12-04 20:38  robert

	* Various files which should have been checked in earlier but were
	  missed...
	  VisualStudio files for flt loader, and header files or Image and
	  Texture
	  for new osg::Texture::CLAMP_TO_EDGE and osg::Image::dirty.

2001-12-04 19:41  robert

	* Updates to the flt loader, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-04 16:03  robert

	* Integrated Brede Johansen's updates to flt loader.

2001-12-04 15:56  robert

	* Made a output message output as osg::DEBUG only.

2001-12-04 12:34  robert

	* Commented out the code to force sgv to use ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO as
	  this should
	  not be the default, will add options to do this later.

2001-12-04 12:31  robert

	* Improved support for anaglyphic stereo.
	  
	  Integrated texture CLAMP_TO_EDGE, submitted by Ulrich Hertlein.

2001-12-02 22:20  robert

	* Beginings of support for quad bufferd, red/green, and slit screen
	  stereo.

2001-12-02 08:59  don

	* Corrected a small booboo in preprocessor guard for header file in
	  GLU and
	  added Matrix::identity() to Matrix

2001-11-30 20:53  robert

	* Fixed bug in osg::StateSet::merge(..) where the containers were
	  being
	  iterated from begin() to begin() rather than begin() to end().

2001-11-21 15:53  don

	* Small fix for preprocessor _MP symbol clash with MFC.

2001-11-19 13:14  robert

	* Made the Warning font file not found message consistent with
	  other file not
	  found messages.

2001-11-19 11:52  robert

	* Added DLL export to the internal classes in osgUtil::Optimize so
	  that the internal
	  classes can be used directly by client applications.

2001-11-19 10:40  robert

	* Added warning report for when a font file cannot be found.

2001-11-18 21:31  robert

	* Added osg::Image::dirtyImage() and setModifiedTag() to allow
	  external
	  updating of the image modified flag to be used in conjunction
	  with
	  texture subloading.

2001-11-15 11:59  robert

	* Move the call to the manipulators before the scene app traversal
	  to that
	  any changes to the scene graph, such as adding an app callback
	  can be
	  seen by during the same frame.

2001-11-14 15:53  robert

	* Fixes for windows compilation

2001-11-14 15:52  robert

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 15:32  robert

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 14:10  robert

	* Added osgUtil::TransformCallback to help with rigid body
	  animation.

2001-11-14 14:09  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.
	  
	  Updates to the osg::Transform, adding preMult and postMult
	  methods and
	  deprecating the old preRotate,preTranslate,preScale.
	  
	  Updated the rest of the OSG so that it nolonger uses the
	  deprecated
	  osg::Transform nodes.
	  
	  Renamed osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalState() to
	  osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalStateSet() so that the name reflects
	  its
	  functionality better. Updated osgGLUT::Viewer etc to cope with
	  new
	  name change.

2001-11-12 10:04  robert

	* Added new files to cvs.

2001-11-12 10:00  robert

	* Added src/osg/NodeCallback.cpp.

2001-11-11 22:32  robert

	* Fixed compilation error in src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp.
	  
	  Added support for nested NodeCallbacks, allowing them to be
	  chained together
	  so that multiple operations can be applied.

2001-11-10 15:46  robert

	* Fixed osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransformsVisitor so that
	  the
	  apply(osg::LOD) scaled the ranges in addition to transform the
	  center
	  point and children.

2001-11-10 13:36  robert

	* Fixed bug related to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransform::Visitor's
	  apply(Billboard& ) method which was apply the accumulated
	  transform to
	  the billbaord geometry when it should have been applying the
	  matrix without
	  the transform component.

2001-11-09 15:06  robert

	* Added osgText::Paragraph which is a subclass from Geode which
	  composes a
	  list of text drawables as a paragraph block, handles breaking of
	  text into
	  individual lines automatically.
	  
	  Changed the osg::Node::setUserData so that the data type has to
	  be an
	  osg::Referenced, and removes the dependancy on
	  osg::MemoryAdapter. I have
	  done this since it simplifies the OSG side of the interface and
	  makes it
	  less like that the user might abuse the memory managment of the
	  data. It
	  does however mean that user data will have by subclassed from
	  Referenced,
	  and therefor may require users to have their own adapter to do
	  this.
	  However, this little nuasance is worth the extra cleaness and
	  robustness
	  afforded by going the osg::Referenced route.

2001-11-09 15:01  robert

	* Fixed the findFileFile routine which had been broken by a fix of
	  a dlopen
	  problem - './' was added to all files which which directly found
	  without
	  requiring a search path rather than just locally found files,
	  this broke
	  file loads which had wern't local but had a valid path. I have
	  moved the
	  './' work around to inside fileDSO and made it only apply to
	  Linux as I
	  presume this is all it was needed for. Don?

2001-11-08 13:50  robert

	* Fixed the IntersectVisitor which was broken by a recent patch to
	  catch parallel
	  line and traingle combinations.

2001-11-07 12:42  robert

	* Added a dirtyBound() to osgUtil::Optimizer.
	  Corrected mispelling of alignment is osg::Text and the osgtext
	  demo.
	  Added guards for divide bu zero's to osg::IntersectVisitor.

2001-11-06 11:36  robert

	* Fixed inlcude/BoundingBox to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 11:07  robert

	* Fixed inlcude/Math to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 10:34  robert

	* Added methods to support isNaN,isInfinte and valid to osg::Vec*
	  and osg::Math,
	  and added a guard to IntersectVisitor which uses these new
	  methods to prevent
	  invalid segments being added.

2001-11-04 19:29  robert

	* Integrated updates to stats sent in my Geoff Michel.

2001-11-02 21:20  don

	* Fixed findFileInPath to prepend ./ if file is in local directory.
	  This was
	  needed by dlopen() for dso's in the current directory

2001-11-02 20:11  robert

	* Updates to Makefiles to include osgText.
	  Also a couple of undefined methods in osgText::Text have been
	  added.

2001-11-02 12:26  robert

	* Updated index.html with dependacy info about the new osgText
	  library.
	  Modified osg/Drawable::draw(..) so that it uses display list
	  COMPILE
	  rather than COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE to solve performance problems
	  under
	  NVidia drivers. The old behavior is still available by comments
	  out
	  a #define.
	  Fixed the default compilation list src/osgPlugins/Makefile so
	  that it
	  compiles by defalt png and gif.

2001-11-01 16:35  robert

	* Updates to the flt loader from Brede Johansen.

2001-11-01 15:13  robert

	* Updates to osgText to fix a crash on ikart.tff font available
	  under Linux, the
	  bug was related to texel padding of the height not be accounted
	  for in texture
	  size calculation, but was used during populating the image data
	  causing a
	  mismatch.

2001-10-31 22:35  robert

	* Added missing config.h file to src/osgPlugins/lib3ds.

2001-10-31 20:04  robert

	* Added a bool paramter to osg::StateSet::compare(const StateSet&
	  rhs,bool compareAttributeContents=false) const;
	  to allow it to use different comparison schemes, now it can use
	  checking for pointer equality (the default)
	  or attribute contexts. This has been added to assist optimization
	  of databases within the flt loader, but
	  also could be useful for other operations too.

2001-10-31 18:33  robert

	* Updated the lib3ds plugin with the new 1.1 version of lib3ds.

2001-10-31 12:27  robert

	* Update to osgText to get things compiling under Windows.

2001-10-31 11:41  robert

	* Update osgText.dsp to define FTGL_STATICLIBRARY to prevent it
	  compiling
	  the as a seperate library and producing linkage warnings.

2001-10-31 10:20  robert

	* Updated the FTGL implemention in osgText to FTFL1.1.

2001-10-30 19:23  robert

	* Further updates to the ReaderWriter support in osgDB, and a fix
	  to a small warning
	  in Matrix.cpp.

2001-10-30 14:20  robert

	* Added support for ReadResult and WriteResult to the
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter
	  to allo plugins to pass back more information about the success
	  or failure
	  of a file load. All plugins have been updated to the new
	  convention.

2001-10-29 19:29  robert

	* Changed a #define ... (GLenum) 0x84fe to 0x84FE to fix problems
	  under MacOS9
	  build.

2001-10-29 12:22  robert

	* Ran to_unix over src/Demos/osgtext/main.cpp to try and fix some
	  return type
	  problems reported under Windows.

2001-10-29 12:19  robert

	* Added missing src/osgText/Version.cpp file.

2001-10-25 01:11  bryan

	* Imposter.cpp added to the project

2001-10-25 00:49  bryan

	* Changed the int to a GLint because of the differences within
	  mac/win32/linux versions of gl.h.

2001-10-25 00:45  bryan

	* sgv is almost working

2001-10-24 23:15  robert

	* Completed work on osgText compilation under Win32. We now
	  have fonts under Wndows and Linux :-)

2001-10-24 22:29  robert

	* Updates to the visual studio files for osgText.

2001-10-24 19:48  robert

	* Updates of osgDB/FileUtils to fix compilation problems under
	  Win32

2001-10-24 13:46  robert

	* Updates to osgText.

2001-10-24 12:53  robert

	* Updates to osgText and osgDB so that the loading of text fonts
	  can use
	  osgDB::findFile() to locate font files from the OSGFILEPATH
	  environmental
	  variable.

2001-10-24 09:41  robert

	* Updated FTGL version to 1.0 and removed a couple of warnings in
	  the osgText demo.

2001-10-24 09:08  robert

	* Updated the osgText implemention, now works under Linux.

2001-10-23 23:23  don

	* Added stat.c

2001-10-23 23:15  don

	* One last change needed to makedefs.linux to sync Linux and Irix
	  pfb loader

2001-10-23 23:10  don

	* Fixed pfb loader functionality for IRIX

2001-10-23 22:59  don

	* Fixed pfb loader so that it works for both Linux and IRix with
	  dynamic
	  libraries, and provides support to load (almost) all that
	  Performer loads.

2001-10-23 22:28  robert

	* Further work on getting osgText compiling.

2001-10-23 22:12  robert

	* Removed old .cc versions of FT font code.

2001-10-23 22:09  robert

	* Adding in new .cpp versions of FT font code.

2001-10-23 22:08  robert

	* Updates to the new osgText library to get it to compile under
	  Linux.

2001-10-23 20:04  robert

	* Converted FTGL files from mac style return to unix style.

2001-10-23 19:51  robert

	* First past integrat of Max Rhiener work on wrapping FTGL to
	  create osgText
	  library and demo.

2001-10-23 15:55  robert

	* Added new osgGLUT::Window base class which is very basic right
	  now, all it does
	  is bring up a GLUT window and provide virtual functions from
	  which users should
	  subclass to add functionality.

2001-10-22 22:02  robert

	* Integrated Geoff Michel's updates to Stats code, whilest move all
	  text rendering
	  back in the viewer from the Statistics header.
	  
	  Added a osg::State::captureCurrentState(StateSet&) method and a
	  copy constructor
	  to osg::StateSet.

2001-10-21 21:27  robert

	* Moved all #include "osg/.." references to #include <osg/..> to
	  aid port to
	  MacOS.

2001-10-20 20:26  robert

	* Added support for an osgUtil::SceneView::init() traversal which
	  is called once
	  per scene view. The user can attach a NodeVisitor to do init for
	  them, or
	  leave it to the default which is to use the
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor
	  which compiles all display lists and texture objects. The init
	  traversal
	  is called automatically by the first call to either app() or
	  cull(), so
	  should not be called by user code during initialization. This
	  ensures
	  that a valid graphics context has been established before OpenGL
	  is initialized.
	  
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor has also been updated to use a bit
	  mask for options, and the addition of
	  compilation of texture objects (via StateAttribute::compile) has
	  also been
	  added.

2001-10-20 09:48  robert

	* Added #ifdef to Performer ReaderWriterPFB so that pfdLoadFile is
	  used under
	  IRIX and pfdLoadFile_pfb is used under Linux.

2001-10-19 15:53  robert

	* Removed Lighting.cpp from repository, it is nolonger used and was
	  just hanging
	  around erroneously.

2001-10-19 15:30  robert

	* Updated the osgUtil::Optimize so that the call to
	  Optimize::StateVisitor is
	  #ifdef out under Win32 and STL port isn't being used. This
	  prevents crashes
	  due to MS's flacky STL implementation.

2001-10-19 14:22  robert

	* Added osgUtil::Optimizer which contains four visitor each
	  designed for doing
	  different types of optimization on the scene graph - state
	  optimization,
	  flattening static transforms, combining LOD's and removing
	  redundent groups.
	  The new Optimizer replaces the once seperate
	  OptimizerStateVisitor.

2001-10-19 12:56  robert

	* Added support for specifying whether view frustum and small
	  feature culling
	  should be applied to a node or its child with the new
	  osg::Node::setCullingActive()
	  flag. A mechanism has been implemented so that if child has its
	  culling disabled
	  then their parents, all the way up to the root are also have
	  their culling
	  implicitly disabled.
	  
	  The osg::CullVisitor has updated to take account of
	  both the explicit control via setCullingActive and the implicit
	  culling
	  disabling through children being disabled.
	  
	  This feature is useful for nodes which don't have a bounding
	  volume to cull
	  against, earth sky implementations and light sources.
	  
	  The default osg::Node::_cullingActive is true, i.e. culling is
	  enabled by
	  default.

2001-10-17 22:17  don

	* Fixed static libraries in madefs.linux and error in
	  ReaderWriterPFB.cpp

2001-10-16 22:30  bryan

	* Update the tree to my version of the project file (I thought it
	  was already in)
	  - Hang glide demo works
	  - sgv is still being fixed

2001-10-16 21:47  robert

	* Reverted Bryan's changes to FrameStamp w.r.t std::tm structure
	  which doesn't
	  compile under Win32 and IRIX. Will need to find another solution.

2001-10-16 21:32  bryan

	* This was the old project file. It's no longer used.

2001-10-16 20:56  bryan

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-16 18:39  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build - submitted by Randall Hopper.

2001-10-16 16:48  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 compilation.

2001-10-16 15:03  robert

	* Fixed then normal smoothing function in the .3ds loader and the
	  osgUtil::SmoothingVisitor so that unused normals at left at 0,0,0
	  insead
	  of being normalized, which results in (nan,nan,nan).

2001-10-16 14:24  robert

	* Completed implementation of a the new CombineLODsVisitor, ideal
	  for use with
	  the .flt loader. Code is stuff currently in sgv, but will be
	  moved out once
	  more testing has been done.

2001-10-16 10:04  robert

	* Added support for transforming LOD and Billboard centers to the
	  OrientationConverter and the flattenTransformVisitor in sgv.

2001-10-16 10:03  robert

	* Modified Veiewer.cpp so that when toggling the light with 'l' the
	  light can
	  be overrided to off and overrided to on, previoulsy it only
	  overrided to off.

2001-10-16 08:24  robert

	* Fixed problem caused by ReaderWriterPFB::writeNode(..) not
	  ensuring that the
	  file extension was .pfb. Have added a check.

2001-10-16 03:59  don

	* added float *() operator to Vec{2,3,4} so we can pass Vec3's
	  directly to
	  OpenGL glVertex?fv().

2001-10-15 15:50  robert

	* Fixes for compilation under IRIX, submitted by Randal Hopper,
	  with mods
	  from Robert.

2001-10-15 14:29  robert

	* Made the new global state attribute instances in osg::State use
	  osg:ref_ptr
	  to automatically handle the memory deletion.

2001-10-15 14:07  robert

	* Added support for automatic creation of global StateAttributes to
	  osg::State,
	  these global attributes are created by cloning any attributes
	  which are
	  applied during rendering, the clone in a shallow copy, which will
	  set up
	  default valus for that attribute. This should prevent attribute
	  bleed
	  from one stateset to the next when the global StateSet doesn't
	  contain
	  an attribute used within the scene graph.

2001-10-15 11:18  robert

	* Fixed rotations to account to the fixes made to Quat and Matrix
	  related to
	  right hand rule rotation.

2001-10-15 08:40  robert

	* The writeImage/Object/Node methods in the .osg and .pfb
	  reader/writer didn't
	  have the new ReaderWriter::Options* structure passed to them,
	  which meant the
	  the virtual functions didn't bind with the new base class methods
	  and wern't
	  called on a write.

2001-10-15 03:32  don

	* Updated pfb loader to load pfb files into osg. Still broken for
	  loading osg
	  files into Performer, however.

2001-10-14 17:54  robert

	* Added osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options class to the ReaderWriter base
	  class, support
	  for settings options in osgDB::Registry, and added the paramter
	  to all of the
	  reaader/writer plugins. The Options structure by default has an
	  string attached
	  for packing basic options, however, it also can be subclassed to
	  encapsulate
	  any users defined option data. In the later case both the client
	  code *and*
	  the plugin need to be aware of subclass, the plugin will need to
	  use
	  dynamic_cast<> to assertain its type.

2001-10-14 16:56  robert

	* Added OrientationConverter.cpp to the VisualStudio project files
	  for osgconv.

2001-10-14 16:55  robert

	* Changed the OrientationConverter.cpp's to have consitent
	  captilization as its
	  associated header file.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* Fixed TransformFunctor code so that it now uses the inverse of
	  the
	  transformation matrix to transform the normal.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* Fixed a bug in Matrix::invert(..) which did not set
	  full_realised=true,
	  so that one Matrices which had not previously be initialized
	  we're
	  erronously initialized later in the code resetting it to
	  identity.

2001-10-14 09:58  robert

	* Added osg::StateSet::merge(const StateSet& rhs) merges merges the
	  modes and
	  attributes of rhs into 'this' stateset.

2001-10-14 09:57  robert

	* Fixed the Flight and Drive manipulators to work with the updated
	  Matrix::rotate
	  code.

2001-10-14 06:01  don

	* Fixed a small boo-boo in definition of bit masks in
	  include/osg/Drawable
	  
	  Fixed incorrect normal conversions for osgconv.

2001-10-14 05:33  don

	* Mr. O added fancy, shmanzy C++ code, but broke normal transform
	  functionality
	  Fixed.

2001-10-14 05:14  don

	* Quick 'n dirty fix to TrackballManipulator to get the rotations
	  doing the
	  right things after the Quat fixes.

2001-10-14 04:50  don

	* Cleaned up some 'make clobber' issues in root Makefile

2001-10-14 04:28  don

	* Quaternions were assigning inverted values during conversion to
	  matricies.
	  This is probably due to an error on the gamasutra web page
	  demonstrating this.
	  It caused left-handed rotations rather than right handed
	  rotations. Should be
	  fixed now.

2001-10-13 11:16  robert

	* Changed the naming and calling convention of the new
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor
	  and have updated GeoSet to use mutable values for the _numverts
	  etc, allowing
	  osg::GeoSet::computeNumVerts() to be a const operation.
	  osg::GeoSet::getNumVerts
	  is now a const once more, so avoiding compilation problems. Also
	  chaned the new
	  osgconv orientation code to use a Drawable::AttributeFunctor so
	  it can work on
	  other Drawables other than just GeoSets.

2001-10-13 09:48  don

	* Added Mr. Osfields dynamic_cast<> and test for validity test.

2001-10-13 08:34  don

	* backed out right-handed coordinate transform for
	  makeRot(vec3,vec3) in Quat.cpp

2001-10-13 08:32  don

	* A few more clean ups

2001-10-13 07:41  don

	* Cleaned up the usage message

2001-10-13 07:24  don

	* Updated osgconv to be able to handle orientation swapping.

2001-10-13 06:23  don

	* Changed some routines to produce right-handed rotations.

2001-10-13 06:22  don

	* checking files in to move development location

2001-10-13 01:28  don

	* Removed personal note in Matrix header file

2001-10-12 20:06  robert

	* Added support for the new AttributeUpdateFunctors.

2001-10-12 20:05  robert

	* Added != method to Vec2,Vec3,Vec4 and did further work on the
	  AttributeUpdateFunctors.

2001-10-12 17:45  don

	* Added include/osg/Math to Makefile TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES and fixed
	  references
	  to _mat in ConvertToPerformer.cpp

2001-10-10 20:20  robert

	* Added support for DYNAMIC/STATIC osg::Transform types and added
	  new osg::Drawable::getStats
	  and supportsAttributeUpdate(..) and applyAttributeUpdate(...)
	  methods which will
	  be to enable hooks into Drawable subclasses.

2001-10-10 14:38  robert

	* Fixed spelling of osg::GeoSet::getNumInterleavedIndices, was
	  missing a 'n'!

2001-10-09 21:55  robert

	* Fixed a crash when opening an erroneous test file (reopen.bmp).

2001-10-09 20:22  robert

	* Updated to fix build problems under MSVC.

2001-10-09 20:09  robert

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 20:03  robert

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 14:18  robert

	* Merged Ben Discoe's clean up of the MSVC files.

2001-10-09 11:58  robert

	* Merged updates to BMP plugin from Geoff Michel. Also modified a
	  little of the
	  code to fix a crash under Linux, Robert Osfield

2001-10-08 19:01  robert

	* Put the makedefs.linux back to default to optimize.

2001-10-08 15:54  robert

	* Fixed a recently introduced crash in the flt plugin which was
	  happen when a
	  std::string was be be set with NULL char*. Also added support for
	  stripping
	  the filename from its original path, inside the osgDB::findFile
	  function.

2001-10-08 08:35  robert

	* Added support for using osgDB::fineFile into the .flt plugin.

2001-10-07 20:10  robert

	* Merged Geoff Michel's udpdates to bmp plugin, and fixed a double
	  fclose bug
	  which was causing a seg fault under Linux.

2001-10-06 20:29  robert

	* Added a osg::DegreesToRadians() and osg::RadiansToDegrees()
	  method to osg/Math,
	  updated the ReaderWriterBMP.cpp (mods sent in my Geoff Michel)
	  and
	  moved the osgUtil::Statistics to osg::Statistics in preperation
	  to adding it
	  to the the Drawable base class.

2001-10-05 19:55  robert

	* Added bmp plugin files, bmp plguin written by Geoff Michel

2001-10-05 10:39  robert

	* Added bmp osgPlugin, written by Geoff Michel.

2001-10-05 10:38  robert

	* Fixed a bug in osg::Image::ensureDimensionsArePowerOfTwo() which
	  only
	  scaled dimensions if *both* axis wern't a power of two, have
	  fixed it
	  to rescale if either of the axis arn't a power to two.

2001-10-05 01:27  bryan

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-04 16:49  robert

	* Added the Copyright message to the top of osgWX, with Ben Disoe's
	  name as
	  he wrote all the code.

2001-10-04 15:12  robert

	* Added a copyright notice to all core headers, which all begin
	  with
	  //C++ header to help scripts and editors pick up the fact that
	  the
	  file is a header file.

2001-10-04 14:39  robert

	* Changed the ordering of comparing modes and attributes in
	  osg::StateAttribute::compare() as part of an investigration into
	  state sorting.

2001-10-04 14:35  robert

	* Added an implemention of basic state sorting to the RenderBin,
	  but have commented
	  out the sort operation as Peformance benifit is currently
	  negligable, will need
	  to improve on the sort functor to see real benifits.

2001-10-04 14:25  robert

	* Added extra precision to the app,cull and draw timings in the
	  Viewer.

2001-10-04 14:20  robert

	* Removed some notify which were only used for debugging of the
	  camera class
	  and are now redudent.

2001-10-04 14:10  robert

	* Changed the numeric ordering of StateAttributes Types, as part of
	  an
	  investigation into state sorting.

2001-10-03 21:44  robert

	* Integrated changes for MacOSX, submitted by Phil Atkin, with
	  small mods by
	  Robert Osfield to maintain compatability under Linux.

2001-10-03 07:56  robert

	* Added missing EarthSky.cpp file to osg plguin.

2001-10-02 15:59  robert

	* Added include/osg/EarthSky and src/osg/EarthSky to cvs.
	  
	  Also move osg across to using radians for angular paramters by
	  default.
	  By defining USE_DEGREES_INTERNALLY you can get the OSG to revert
	  to
	  the old style degrees. This later feature is deprecated and only
	  meant
	  for helping comptability in the interim.

2001-10-02 11:36  robert

	* Added osg::EarthSky node to the core osg library, and added
	  support for it into
	  osgUtil::SceneView, osg::CullVisitor, osgPlugin/osg and updated
	  the hangglide
	  demo to use the new earth sky node.

2001-10-01 23:02  robert

	* Added support for osg::StateSet comparison operators and using
	  this new feature
	  added support in osgUtil::OptimizeStateVisitor for removing
	  duplicate
	  StateSet's from the scene graph, previously only duplicated
	  StateAttributes
	  we're removed.

2001-10-01 12:06  robert

	* Integrated a bug fix to osg::TexMat from Geoff Michel which adds
	  a
	  glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); after the setting of the texture
	  matrix.
	  Previously the texture matrix mode could run into normal model
	  view
	  matrix operations which were assuming the defaul of GL_MODELVIEW.

2001-10-01 11:15  robert

	* Made spelling corrections, the spelling mistakes picked up by a
	  script
	  written by Neil Salter.
	  
	  script

2001-09-30 20:41  robert

	* Interegrated changes to Timer from Neil Salter to fix compilation
	  problems which had been introduced by doing #include's within the
	  osg namespace.

2001-09-29 18:34  robert

	* Added setAttributeAndModes(new Depth,StateAttribute::ON);
	  to the StateSet::setGlobalDefault() so that the correct default
	  for the glDepthFunc etc are set up for scene graphs, and allows
	  override of these value which risk of inheriting state on to the
	  rest of the scene graph.
	  
	  This has allowed the hangglide demo to be simplified since it now
	  doesn't need to set the global Depth instance itself.

2001-09-29 09:37  robert

	* Modified the Matrix multiple method added by Don so it is safer
	  and added comments explaining why it shouldn't be needed as other
	  more efficient methods should be doing the work for us.
	  
	  Also added Matrix::ensureRealized() to support the lazy
	  initialization of Matrix, whilest keeping the implementation
	  robust so that external calls to Matrix which get values do so on
	  an initialized matrix.

2001-09-29 02:48  don

	* Added operator * (Matrix &) to Matrix (header) and
	  operator [] to reference matrix elements.

2001-09-28 20:10  robert

	* Made spelling corrections to osg include files, spelling mistakes
	  detected by a script written by Neil Salter which analyses
	  comments for mistakes.

	* Trying to clean up binary commits

2001-09-19 23:56  don

	* Added these with the -kb flag now.

2001-09-19 23:55  don

	* Cleaning up binary commits - oops

2001-09-19 23:52  don

	* 1) new implementation of the osg::Matrix class. Note details
	  below.
	  2) cleaned up osg::Timer, still in progress. My intent has been
	  to
	  pave the way for support for other OS's.
	  3) new osg::FrameStamp class which has a frame number, reference
	  time for each frame to be app, culled and drawn. The FrameStamp
	  also can be passed to other machines (i.e. cluster) and the
	  FrameStamp can be used with the slaves own app,cull and draw.
	  I've also added the beginings of a calander time data to the
	  FrameStamp to allow time or day and year to be used in setting
	  up position of sun/moon etc. etc.
	  4) The osg::State now has contains a pointer to the last applied
	  osg::Camera and the current osg::FrameStamp, so that drawables
	  can use both pieces of information for creating effects such
	  CLOD, earth/sky etc. The osg::NodeVisitor also now allows you
	  to attach a FrameStamp to support syncronization of actions on
	  the scene graph.

2001-09-19 23:46  don

	* o Added osgUtil::StateOptimizeVisitor which traversing the scene
	  graph and builds up a map of all StateAttributes and StateSets
	  and then removes the duplicates. This promotes state sharing
	  throughout the scene graph which inturn can significantly improve
	  performance thanks to reduced state changing. Particularily
	  effective on datasets where a great deal of duplicated state
	  exists.
	  o Added pure virtual compare(const osg::StateAttribute&)
	  method to osg::StateAttribute, and implemented it in all the
	  subclasses from StateAttribute. Added <,== & != operator
	  on StateAttribute and Matrix to support new StateOptimizeVisitor.
	  o Added META_Object, META_Node and META_StateAttribute macros to
	  Object, Node and StateAttribute respectively which define the
	  standard pure virtual methods such as clone, className
	  & isSameKindAs. Changed all the appropriate header files to
	  use these macro's rather define them in each header, these cleans
	  up the headers considerably.
	  o Corrected the implementation of osg::Light::getType so it
	  correctly
	  uses a unique type for each of the OpenGL lights (GL_LIGHT0..
	  GL_LIGHT7 relates to osg::StateAttriburte::LIGHT_0..LIGHT_7.
	  o Changed the definition of osg::StateStateAttribute::Type to
	  is now a unsigned int rather than an enum, and have changed the
	  name of the previous Type enum list to be Types. This makes it
	  more consistent with the difination of values found in
	  StateAttribute
	  and also easier to extend with having to cast to an enum.
	  o From Pail Fredrikson, updated Maitrx.new implemention which
	  uses
	  the same matrix orientation as the original Matrix implemention.

2001-09-19 23:41  don

	* o Updated Metrowerks files for MacOS. They aren't 100% there yet,
	  but getting there.
	  
	  o First cut of osgcluster demo. Very simple beginings. Alas
	  I only one PC here so I can't test it in its current guise.
	  
	  o New support for NodeCallbacks, via AppCallback attached to
	  osg::Node's, and a default osgUtil::AppVisitor which calls them
	  on
	  each frame.
	  
	  o Support for traversal masks in osg::NodeVisitor, osg::Node
	  which allows nodes to be switched on or off via a bit mask.
	  
	  o Suppport for traversal number (frame number) and reference time
	  into osg::NodeVisitor to handle syncronization of app and cull
	  traversals. This also assist clustering as traversal number
	  master to slaves.
