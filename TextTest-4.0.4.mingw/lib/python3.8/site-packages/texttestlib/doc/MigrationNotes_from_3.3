This only applies to users of the LSF module.

TextTest now integrates with Sun Grid Engine as well as LSF. This has caused the renaming of a few
variables to more generic names than they had before.

In the config file, the
'lsf_queue' entry becomes 'default_queue'

The environment variables
LSF_RESOURCE and LSF_PROCESSES become
QUEUE_SYSTEM_RESOURCE and QUEUE_SYSTEM_PROCESSES respectively.
