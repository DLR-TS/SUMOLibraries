.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program creates a regular grid (raster) from the scattered data read from
the OGR datasource. Input data will be interpolated to fill grid nodes with
values, you can choose from various interpolation methods.
.sp
It is possible to set the \fI\%GDAL_NUM_THREADS\fP
configuration option to parallelize the processing. The value to specify is
the number of worker threads, or \fBALL_CPUS\fP to use all the cores/CPUs of the
computer.

.B \-ot <type>
Force the output image bands to have a specific data type supported by the
driver, which may be one of the following: \fBByte\fP, \fBInt8\fP, \fBUInt16\fP,

by the relevant driver, causing a error.
.INDENT 0.0

Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the

.SS linear
.sp
New in version 2.1.

.sp
Linear interpolation algorithm.
.sp
The Linear method performs linear interpolation by computing a Delaunay
triangulation of the point cloud, finding in which triangle of the triangulation
the point is, and by doing linear interpolation from its barycentric coordinates
within the triangle.
If the point is not in any triangle, depending on the radius, the
algorithm will use the value of the nearest point or the nodata value.
.sp
It has following parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBradius\fP: In case the point to be interpolated does not fit
into a triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, use that maximum distance to search a nearest
neighbour, or use nodata otherwise. If set to \-1, the search distance is infinite.
If set to 0, nodata value will be always used. Default is \-1.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnodata\fP: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default
0.0).

node (center of the search ellipse) and all of the data points found in grid
node search ellipse.
.IP \(bu 2

points found in grid node search ellipse. The distance between each pair of
points within ellipse is calculated and average of all distances is set as a
grid node value.
.UNINDENT
.sp
All the metrics have the same set of options:
.INDENT 0.0

(counter clockwise, default 0.0).
.IP \(bu 2

NODATA marker. This is only used if search ellipse is set (both radii are
non\-zero). Default is 0.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmax_points_per_quadrant\fP: Maximum number of data points to use per quadrant.
Default is 0. Added in GDAL 3.6.
When specified, the algorithm will only take into account up to max_points_per_quadrant
points for each of the right\-top, left\-top, right\-bottom and right\-top quadrant
relative to the point being interpolated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmin_points_per_quadrant\fP: Minimum number of data points to use per quadrant.
Default is 0. Added in GDAL 3.6.
If that number is not reached, the point being interpolated will be set with
the NODATA marker.

points for each of the right\-top, left\-top, right\-bottom and right\-top quadrant
relative to the point being interpolated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnodata\fP: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default
0.0).
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fBmin_points_per_quadrant\fP or \fBmax_points_per_quadrant\fP is specified, the

from the first quadrant, then the closest point to the point being interpolated
from the second quadrant, etc. up to the 4th quadrant, and will continue with
the next closest point in the first quadrant, etc. until \fBmax_points\fP and/or
\fBmax_points_per_quadrant\fP thresholds are reached.
.SH READING COMMA SEPARATED VALUES
.sp
Often you have a text file with a list of comma separated XYZ values to work
with (so called CSV file). You can easily use that kind of data source in
\fBgdal_grid\fP\&. All you need is to create a virtual dataset header (VRT) for your CSV
file and use it as an input datasource for \fBgdal_grid\fP\&. You can find details
on the VRT format on the \fI\%VRT \-\- Virtual Format\fP description page.
.sp
Here is a small example. Let\(aqs say we have a CSV file called \fIdem.csv\fP
containing
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Easting,Northing,Elevation
86943.4,891957,139.13
87124.3,892075,135.01
86962.4,892321,182.04
87077.6,891995,135.01
\&...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the above data we will create a \fIdem.vrt\fP header with the following
content:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTLayer name=\(dqdem\(dq>
        <SrcDataSource>dem.csv</SrcDataSource>
        <GeometryType>wkbPoint</GeometryType>
        <GeometryField encoding=\(dqPointFromColumns\(dq x=\(dqEasting\(dq y=\(dqNorthing\(dq z=\(dqElevation\(dq/>
    </OGRVRTLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This description specifies so called 2.5D geometry with  three  coordinates
X,  Y and Z. The Z value will be used for interpolation. Now you can
use \fIdem.vrt\fP with all OGR programs (start  with  \fI\%ogrinfo\fP  to  test  that
everything works fine). The datasource will contain a single layer called
\fI\(dqdem\(dq\fP  filled  with point features constructed from values in the CSV file.
Using this technique you can handle CSV  files  with  more  than  three
columns, switch columns, etc. OK, now the final step:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
gdal_grid dem.vrt demv.tif
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or, if we do not wish to use a VRT file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
gdal_grid \-l dem \-oo X_POSSIBLE_NAMES=Easting \e
\-oo Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES=Northing \-zfield Elevation dem.csv dem.tif
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your CSV file does not contain column headers then it can be handled
in the VRT file in the following way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<GeometryField encoding=\(dqPointFromColumns\(dq x=\(dqfield_1\(dq y=\(dqfield_2\(dq z=\(dqfield_3\(dq/>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%Comma Separated Value (.csv)\fP description page contains
details on CSV format supported by GDAL/OGR.
.SH CREATING MULTIBAND FILES
.sp
Creating multiband files is not directly possible with gdal_grid.
One might use gdal_grid multiple times to create one band per file,
and then use \fI\%gdalbuildvrt\fP \-separate and then \fI\%gdal_translate\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
gdal_grid ... 1.tif; gdal_grid ... 2.tif; gdal_grid ... 3.tif
gdalbuildvrt \-separate 123.vrt 1.tif 2.tif 3.tif
gdal_translate 123.vrt 123.tif
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or just \fI\%gdal_merge.py\fP, to combine the one\-band files into a single one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
gdal_grid ... a.tif; gdal_grid ... b.tif; gdal_grid ... c.tif
gdal_merge.py \-separate a.tif b.tif c.tif \-o d.tif
.ft P

.SH C API
.sp
This utility is also callable from C with \fI\%GDALGrid()\fP\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The following would create raster TIFF file from VRT datasource described in
\fI\%Reading comma separated values\fP section using the inverse distance to a power method.
Values to interpolate will be read from Z value of geometry record.

The next command does the same thing as the previous one, but reads values to
interpolate from the attribute field specified with \fB\-zfield\fP option
instead of geometry record. So in this case X and Y coordinates are being
taken from geometry and Z is being taken from the \fI\(dqElevation\(dq\fP field.
The \fI\%GDAL_NUM_THREADS\fP is also set to parallelize the computation.
