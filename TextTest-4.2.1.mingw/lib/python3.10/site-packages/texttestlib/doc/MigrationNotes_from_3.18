Nothing to migrate as such, but note the following behaviour changes:

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Naming scheme for new test suites
=====================================
If you create a new test suite with TextTest 3.19 or later you'll find it has different
naming conventions for the standard streams. Files that were called "input.<app>", "output.<app>"
and "errors.<app>" will now get called "stdin.<app>", "stdout.<app>" and "stderr.<app>". This is
because the old naming scheme was deemed confusing to newbies and the hope is the newer names
make it easier to infer what the file is.

You can convert to the new naming scheme by setting

filename_convention_scheme:standard

after which you'll of course have to rename your files. To suppress this for new test suites,
delete the line from the generated config file that looks like the one above.

It would basically have introduced too much migration to have just removed the old naming scheme.

(2) Various warnings "upgraded"
===============================
Various errors and warnings that previously only got written in batch mode log files will now
appears also when you run the UI. For example, if a "testsuite" file refers to a test that cannot
be found. Basically you'll need to fix these things now whereas before they could largely be ignored.
