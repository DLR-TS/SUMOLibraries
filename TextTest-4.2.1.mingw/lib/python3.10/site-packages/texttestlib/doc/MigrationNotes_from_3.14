The main things that need migrating are version-specific "options" files. Otherwise there are a couple
of changes in behaviour you might want to note.

=========================================================
COMPULSORY MIGRATION
=========================================================
(1) Versioned "options" files.

TextTest 3.15 handles options files much more like e.g. "environment" files and "knownbugs" files have
been handled up until now. It allows them to be placed in test suites and view them as cumulative, i.e. it attempts 
to amalgamate them with each other. This breaks backward compatibility in the case where
you have tests that contain both "options.app" and "options.app.v1" files. For example, if
options.app contains "-a" and options.app.v1 contains "-b", then if you run version v1 of the
test it will now run with "-a -b" rather than just "-b" as before.

Many such versioned files simply add an extra option, if so you just need to delete the repeated options.
The simplest way to restore backward compatibility is to add {CLEAR} to the beginning of the line,
in which case all other options files will be ignored.

You can also for example do {CLEAR -a} which in this case will have the same effect. See the guide
to test suites on the website for more complete documentation of this new feature.

(2) Bug system location no longer recognises "default"

This was never intentionally supported, but it has previously worked to identify your only bug system
(e.g. bugzilla here) with 

bug_system_location:http://bugzilla.mysite.com

or even

[bug_system_location]
default:http://bugzilla.mysite.com

This will not work any more. You have to explicitly say what bug system it is, i.e. 

[bug_system_location]
bugzilla:http://bugzilla.mysite.com

Hopefully anyone with any sense did that anyway, but just in case :)

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Dynamic GUI no longer writes to standard output directly
============================================================
It uses the logging mechanism like everything else. To restore the output by
default, copy the log/logging.console file from the TextTest source tree to
$TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/log/logging.gui (i.e. ~/.texttest/log/logging.gui 
unless you repoint the personal configuration directory)

(2) Data file configuration now lives under $TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/etc
=========================================================================
Also for consistency with the log layout. If you have .gtkrc-2.0 or .xml files
for configuring the tool bar in your personal configuration, you'll need to move them
to this subdirectory.

(3) Default "debug" logging file now called logging.debug instead of log4py.conf
================================================================================
For consistency with the above. So you need to go to $TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/log if
you have such a location and do this rename.
