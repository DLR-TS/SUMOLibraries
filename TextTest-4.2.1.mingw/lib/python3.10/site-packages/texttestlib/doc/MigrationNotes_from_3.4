(1) Due to resurrected support on Windows, the configuration 'unixConfig'
is no longer present or necessary. The few UNIX-specific things left
are inferrred by running the configuration 'default' on a UNIX system.

In other words, if your config file says
config_module:unixConfig

delete this line.

(2) This applies to anyone who was tried to measure CPU time or memory consumption
with texttest. The config file format of most settings has changed.

Because any number of resource-related files can now be extracted, the settings are 
now more like the batch settings, each is a section, with type names. So, for example,
instead of

performance_test_resource:model=Opteron250

you would now write

[performance_test_resource]
cputime:model=Opteron250

Likewise, minimum_cputime_for_test and minimum_memory_for_test are replaced by

[performance_test_minimum]
cputime:10
memory:5

The name 'cputime' for UNIX time-generated CPU time is hardcoded. The rest you can 
set yourself. Use the entry

[performance_logfile_extractor]
memory:Memory Usage Is

to tell TextTest how to create the file from your log file. (This replaces 'string_before_memory'.) The file name 'memory' no longer has any special meaning.

There is also a new entry, that can tell it to use a file other than the one indicated by log_file
for this purpose: as follows.

[performance_logfile]
memory:output

In summary, the changes are follows:

Old names                               New Names
=========                               =========
performance_test_machine (list)         performance_test_machine (section)
performance_test_resource (list)        performance_test_resource (section)
<cputime|memory>_variation_% (int)      performance_variation_% (section)
minimum_<cputime|memory>_for_test (int) performance_test_minimum (section)
string_before_memory (string)           performance_logfile_extractor (section)

Note for migrators (or checkers): check your sections end correctly. If you have global level 
settings after a section, an [end] marker will be needed to make sure that they don't end up 
in the section! Otherwise they will not be included.

(example)

[performance_test_machine]
cputime:apple

config_module:default

(This will not work as config_module will be entered in the section [performance_test_machine]. Use an [end] marker after the section.)
