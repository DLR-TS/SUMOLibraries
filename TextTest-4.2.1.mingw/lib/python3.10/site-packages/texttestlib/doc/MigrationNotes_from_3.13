There is almost certainly no migration needed. The main incompatibility
is that it won't work to reconnect to runs done by version 3.13.

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Missing "traffic" or "usecase" files
========================================
Both of these files are expected to be regenerated, either by TextTest itself ("traffic") or
your GUI simulation tool of choice ("usecase"). But previously TextTest has never complained
if they have not been regenerated.

This is now changed, so on running TextTest 3.14 you might get a load of tests reporting
"missing traffic" or "missing usecase" that have worked previously.

In all probability the files in question were simply not used before and can safely be removed. 
If however they were needed but are not regenerated for some reason, you can restore the old 
handling via the following in your config file.

# Don't complain if the traffic file is missing...
[definition_file_stems]
regenerate:{CLEAR traffic}
builtin:traffic
[end]

Obviously you can swap "traffic" for "usecase" if appropriate. 

(2) Exit codes now collected by default
=======================================
TextTest now collects the exit code from the system under test along with the standard 
output and standard error. So if your program returns non-zero
exit codes you will find tests reporting "exitcode new" (zero exit code
will not create such a file). There are two things you can do at this point:

a) Save the files and check them in, and be happy that this is now being monitored.
b) Set "discard_file:exitcode" in your config file which will restores the previous default behaviour. 

(3) Default value of TEXTTEST_TMP is changed
============================================
It used to be ~/texttesttmp on UNIX and $TEMP on Windows. It's been changed
to $TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/tmp (i.e. ~/.texttest/tmp unless you repoint the
personal configuration directory) as that seemed more consistent, and nicer than polluting
several different locations with TextTest's files.

(4) collate_file is now a list
==============================
When collating a file you used to have to specify a single path or glob to read it from.
Now you can provide multiple ones. One effect of this is that if you've tried to
disabled a collation in some version with

[collate_file]
some_file:

this won't work any more. You'll need to change it to

[collate_file]
some_file:{CLEAR LIST}

(5) "Internal errors" now reported in preference to "known bugs". 
=================================================================
If you have a lot of "knownbugs" files you may run into this. It's the case that "internal
errors" should be more serious than "known bugs" so should get chosen in preference. If you
have lots of things reporting "internal error" just so you can ignore errors in other files, note
that this functionality is now decoupled and you can replace "internal_error" with 
"ignore_other_errors". They will then get reported as "known bug" also.
