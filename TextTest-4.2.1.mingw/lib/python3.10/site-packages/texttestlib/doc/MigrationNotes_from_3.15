The main things that need migrating are "collate_file" settings which collate multiple files simultaneously. 

=========================================================
COMPULSORY MIGRATION
=========================================================

(1) "collate_file" as applied to multiple files at once
=======================================================

For a long time it has been possible to write in your config file e.g.

[collate_file]
data*:data*.dump

by which it is intended to collate all files that match the pattern on the right
and produce corresponding files without the dump suffix. This functionality
has been completely rewritten since the TextTest 3.15 release to remove
its assumptions about the form of the files and make it work more generally.

Also, the new version actually takes account of what is on the left-hand-side
whereas the old version pretty much took the name of the source file and ignored
what you put there. This is generally where the migration comes in.

The worst that will happen is that a bunch of collated files will change name. For
example if I instead had written

[collate_file]
dumped_data*:data*.dump

the files would still have been called "data*" anyway. Now TextTest will replace
the matched strings and make use of the name in a more predictable way, which may
produce a different name than you had before. It's usually fairly easy to change the
name in the config file if you prefer that over renaming lots of files.

One additional restriction is that only "*" characters may be used in the left-hand-side
patterns: they are effectively replacement markers for the matched values from the source file names. 
Previously any UNIX-style file pattern would trigger this functionality.

See the website documentation of "collate_file" for full documentation of how this now works.

CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Default toolbar changed
===========================
"Remove Tests" and "Remove Files" are now separate actions, so it wasn't reckoned a good idea
to keep "Remove" in the toolbar as it wasn't clear which it referred to. So "Refresh" now appears
there and "Remove" needs to be done from the popup or top menus, or via the accelerator.
Naturally you can configure this if you want, see the website on "Personalising the UI".

(2) HTML batch report appearance changed
========================================
Most of the changes there will occur by default. For example, an "index.html" page will be
generated at the top level providing an overview of the status. Rows or tables full of "N/A"
will no longer be shown. There shouldn't be any surprises.
