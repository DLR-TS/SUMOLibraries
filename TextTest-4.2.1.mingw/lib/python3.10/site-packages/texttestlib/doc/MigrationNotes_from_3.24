(1) Grid Engine submission no longer forwards the entire environment
====================================================================
Anyone using Grid Engine (UGE/SGE) should note that the setup no longer tells UGE to copy the 
entire environment when submitting jobs. (In detail, it does not send the -V flag to the qsub program)

The previous behaviour could lead to some very strange errors, such as when display/shell related 
variables were forwarded to machines with a different OS where they didn't make sense.

It has previously worked to set environment variables outside of TextTest, e.g. via a starter 
script, and then just start TextTest. This will not work any more with UGE/SGE, you will need 
to set them via TextTest's own environment file mechanism.

Alternatively, to restore the previous behaviour, you can add

queue_system_submit_args:-V 

to your config file, which will once again forward your entire environment to the remote job.
