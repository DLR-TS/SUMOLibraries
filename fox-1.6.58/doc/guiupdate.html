What is Automatic GUI Updating?

<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Traditionally, Controls such as Buttons and Sliders have been used to
  provide notifications to the application code that a certain command is
  to be performed, or some value has changed.&nbsp; For example, if one moves
  a Slider a little bit, a notification message informs the application that
  a new value is available; at the same time, the Slider's position will
  give a <I>visual cue</I> about the value being transmitted to the application
  code.</p>

  <p>But suppose one were to add a TextField to control the same variable.&nbsp;
  If we type into the TextField, the new value will be transmitted to the
  application just fine, but since the slider was not moved, the visual position
  of the slider now no longer represents the value that the program is actually
  working with.</p>

  <p>Traditionally, GUI developers have solved this problem roughly like this:
  <ul>
  <li>When receiving a message from the Slider Control, the program accepts the new value, and then turns around and sets the new value in the TextField.</LI>
  <BR>
  <LI>When receiving a message from the TextField, the program similarly accepts the new value from the TextField and now updates the Slider.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p>The above pattern seems eminently reasonable.&nbsp; Up till now, this was how it was done [although certain toolkits&nbsp; didn't&nbsp; make even this simple approach very easy!].</p>

  <p>However, now imagine a large program being implemented by several developers,
  and a graphical user interface that has hundreds, perhaps even thousands
  of Controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; All these controls manipulate a bunch of data in the application program.
  <BR>We can see the problem with this approach: how is developer <I>A</I>
  supposed to know that the Dialog panel being designed by developer <I>B</I>
  is to reflect the new values for the variables being modified by developer
  <I>A</I>'s
  code?&nbsp; Clearly, this problem can grow&nbsp; into a combinatorial nighmare.</p>
  <P>The GUI Updating facility implemented in FOX can largely eliminate this
  problem.&nbsp; In a nutshell, the idea is that in FOX, the GUI Controls
  are <B><I>bi-directional</I></B>:</p>
  <UL>
  <LI>A Control can&nbsp; <B><I>notify</I></B>&nbsp; the application program to inform it that the Control has been given a new value by the user. One could call this a ``<B><I>push</I></B>.''</LI>
  <BR>
  <LI>A Control can also <B><I>interrogate</I></B> the application about the
      current state of the application and its data structures, so that the Control
      may properly reflect this graphically.&nbsp; This one could call a ``<B><I>pull</I></B>.''</LI>
  </UL>
  <p>Why is this good?&nbsp; Because it <B><I>compartmentalizes</I></B> large
  scale GUI design, and <B><I>simplifies coding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </I></B>In the
  above example, developer <I>B</I> wouldn't even need to <I>talk</I> to
  developer <I>A</I>.&nbsp; He would simply implement [for each Control in
  his Dialog panel]&nbsp; not only the ``command'' messages which notify
  his routines about user inputs, but also the ``update'' messages by which
  the Controls ask for the values they should be displaying.
  </p>

  <p>Coding complexity is reduced because instead of N command messages each
  updating M Controls [for a total of N x M combinations], the developer
  would only have to implement N command messages and M update messages [just
  N + M combinations].&nbsp; Complexity is also reduced because <I>command
  handlers</I> just perform their operation on the application data structures,
  and <I>update handlers</I> simply update the corresponding controls given
  the state in which they found these data structures.</p>

  <p>A common use of the GUI Updating mechanism is the <B><I>disabling</I></B>
  or ``<B><I>graying-out</I></B>'' of controls when they're not applicable
  under certain conditions.&nbsp; For example, a <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Save
  File </FONT></B>Button may be made unavailable when the application hasn't
  loaded a file yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other common uses include hiding or showing
  of Controls in the GUI based on context or which ``mode'' an application
  is in.</p>

<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>An example of GUI Updating is given in the ScribbleApp program.&nbsp;
  The ScribbleApp program allows lines to be drawn in some canvas.&nbsp;
  To clear the canvas, the users invokes the <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><U>C</U>lear</FONT></B>
  Button.&nbsp; The <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><U>C</U>lear </FONT></B>Button
  is to be available only when something has been scribbled; otherwise, it
  is to be grayed out or desensitized.&nbsp; One can accomplish this in FOX
  as follows:</p>
<pre>
// Construct the Clear Button

new FXButton(buttonFrame,"&amp;Clear",NULL,
             app,ScribbleApp::ID_CLEAR,
             FRAME_THICK|FRAME_RAISED|LAYOUT_FILL_X|LAYOUT_TOP|LAYOUT_LEFT,
             0,0,0,0,10,10,5,5);
</pre>

<P>This constructs a new Button object, which will send a message ID_CLEAR
to the application object (app). In the application object, we catch <B><I>two</I></B> message types
from the Clear button:</p>

<pre>
// Message Map for the Scribble App class

FXDEFMAP(ScribbleApp) ScribbleAppMap[]={
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_LEFTBUTTONPRESS,&nbsp;&nbsp; ScribbleApp::ID_MOUSE,&nbsp; ScribbleApp::onMouseDown),
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_LEFTBUTTONRELEASE, ScribbleApp::ID_MOUSE,&nbsp; ScribbleApp::onMouseUp),
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_MOTION,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScribbleApp::ID_MOUSE,&nbsp; ScribbleApp::onMouseMove),
  FXMAPFUNC(<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">SEL_COMMAND</FONT>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">ID_CLEAR</FONT>,&nbsp; ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">onCmdClear</FONT>),
  FXMAPFUNC(<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">SEL_UPDATE</FONT>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">ID_CLEAR</FONT>,&nbsp; ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">onUpdClear</FONT>),
};

</pre>

<P>The SEL_COMMAND message indicates that the Clear button has been pressed;
its action will be to clear the drawing canvas:</p>

<pre>
// Handle the clear message

long ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">onCmdClear</FONT>(FXObject*,FXSelector,void*){
  FXDC *dc=canvas->DC();

  // Erase the canvas
  dc->begin(canvas);
  dc->setForeground(FXRGB(255,255,255));
  dc->fillRectangle(0,0,canvas->getWidth(),canvas->getHeight());
  dc->end();

  dirty=0;
  return 1;
  }
</pre>

<P>The SEL_UPDATE message is sent when the Clear Button updates itself.&nbsp;
The GUI-Update handler determines whether the Clear Button should be sensitized
or not depending on whether any drawing has taken place in the canvas;
this is kept track of through a flag variable <b>dirty</B>:</p>

<pre>
// Handle the GUI Update from the Clear button
long ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">onUpdClear</FONT>(FXObject* sender,FXSelector,void*){
  FXButton* button=(FXButton*)sender;

  // Button is available when canvas is dirty only
  dirty ? button->enable() : button->disable();
  return 1;
  }

</pre>

<P>Note that in this case we know the origin of the message (the <I>sender</I>)
to be of the type FXButton, so we can simply <I>cast</I> the sender object
down to the appropriate type. In general however, we may not always know [the only thing we know
is that the sender is of type FXObject].&nbsp; In that a case, the GUI
Update handler should <I>send a message back
</I>to the sender.
We can safely do this since all FOX objects are derived from FXObject,
and FXObject's can be sent messages.&nbsp; This leads to the following
code:</p>

<pre>
// Update sender
long ScribbleApp::<FONT COLOR="#FF6666">onUpdClear</FONT>(FXObject* sender,FXSelector,void*){
  sender->handle(this,dirty ? FXSEL(SEL_COMMAND,ID_ENABLE) : FXSEL(SEL_COMMAND,ID_DISABLE),NULL);
  return 1;
  }
</pre>


<p>Many FOX Widgets understand the ID_ENABLE, and ID_DISABLE messages;&nbsp;
if however, a message is sent to a sender that doesn't, nothing bad will
happen as no message handler will be associated with the message.</p>

When is GUI Updating Performed?
<br><img src='art/line.gif' width=100% height=1></b></td></tr></table>
</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>There are two sides to this question:- under what conditions can a Control
  be updated, and when is the updating actually done. With regard to the first part, a Control can be <I>updated</I> whenever
  it is <I>not currently being manipulated</I> by the user.&nbsp; In other
  words, a Control is normally in a ``<B><I>pull</I></B>'' mode, in that
  it tries to interrogate the application to determine the value it needs
  to display graphically.&nbsp; As soon as the user starts to manipulate
  the Control, it switches to a ``<B><I>push</I></B>'' mode, in which the
  Control becomes an <I>input</I> of new values to the application.</p>

  <p>As far as the second part of the question goes, the FOX library performs
  the GUI Updates when there isn't much else to do, that is to say, the system
  is about to block and wait for events from the user.&nbsp; Furthermore,
  the GUI Updates are only performed when previous events have been dispatched
  and handled. This is why it is important to return <B>1</B> or <B>0</B> in your message
  handlers.:</p>

  <UL>
  <LI> If you return <B>1</B>, the message is considered handled, and a GUI Update pass will be performed by FOX.</LI>
  <LI> If you return <B>0</B>, the message is considered unhandled, and since unhandled messages should not have changed the application's state, no GUI Update is performed.</LI>
  </UL>

  <p>For increased efficiency, the system checks for new events between each
  GUI Update message, to prevent ``event-deafness'' for extended periods
  of time.&nbsp; Even so, it is important to restrict your GUI Update message
  handlers to small routines, and to not perform any major computations in
  GUI Update message handlers.</p>
</ul>

Automatic Gray Out or Hide

</p>
<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>FOX also has the option to automatically gray out or hide certain Widgets.&nbsp;
  Both options work very similar, and differ only visually.&nbsp; When automatic
  grayout is in effect, the Widget will be automatically grayed out (disabled,
  or desensitized to user inputs), when one of the following is true:</p>

  <OL>
  <LI>The Widget's target is NULL.</LI>
  <LI>The Widget's target does not handle the Widget's SEL_UPDATE message.</LI>
  </OL>

  <p>Why is this useful?&nbsp; If a Widget's target is an object that performs
  some sort of message <B><I>delegation</I></B> (for example, FXMDIClient
  and FXMDIChild do this), then the ability to handle a certain SEL_UPDATE
  message may depend on the delegate object that is in effect at the time
  the update message is sent.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the particular delegate in effect
  does not handle the update message, there is no handler to make a Widget
  assume the correct state.</p>

  <p>With automatic gray out, however, the absence of a handler for the SEL_UPDATE
  message can be turned into an action to gray out the Widget instead.&nbsp;
  This will keep the GUI consistent even in the absence of update message
  handlers.</p>

  <p>The automatic gray out technique is of particular significance when
  using MDI (Multiple Document Interface) widgets as both FXMDIClient and
  FXMDIChild perform message delegation.&nbsp; Messages from the pulldown
  menus are typically sent to the FXMDIClient, and then subsequently forwarded
  by the FXMDIClient to the active FXMDIChild (Sometimes, there are no FXMDIChild
  windows, and the message can not be forwarded and then the message handler
  returns 0).</p>

  <p>As automatic gray out of Widgets will cause a gray out if no handler
  for the SEL_UPDATE message is found, it is imperative that the SEL_UPDATE
  must always be handled when the Widget should be sensitive.&nbsp; The update
  message handler does not necessarily have to do anything, it just needs
  to return 1.</p>

  <p>To handle this common situation, FXWindow defines just such a message
  handler for you:&nbsp; <B>FXWindow::onUpdYes()<TT> </TT></B>will do nothing
  but show and sensitize the Widget that is the sender of the message, and
  return a 1.&nbsp; You can simply append this to your message map as in:</p>
<pre>
  FXMAPFUNC(SEL_UPDATE,ID_MYMENU,<FONT COLOR="#000000">FXWindow::onUpdYes</FONT>)
</pre>

  <p>That will take care of it.&nbsp; Of course if the update message should
  do something, you should write your own handler and make it return 1.</p>

Delayed Repaint/Layout

<!--- TOPIC TITLE -->
<ul>
  <p>Procrastination is Good Thing [even though my parents always told me
  otherwise :-)].&nbsp; The motto is <I>the fastest thing you can do is nothing
  at all.</I> Indeed, my lowly Pentium Classic can do ``<B><I>nothing</I></B>
  ''as fast as the fastest supercomputer!</p>

  <p>All this seems pretty obvious, but what does it mean for GUI systems?&nbsp;
  It means we should try to <B>avoid</B> doing the two most expensive things
  that GUI systems have to do:</p>

  <OL>
  <LI><B>Drawing onto the screen</B>.&nbsp; Drawing generates X protocol,&nbsp;
  and causes context switching between client and display server, and is
  therefore very expensive.</LI>
  <BR>
  <LI><B>Layout of widgets</B>.&nbsp; Layout involves recursing up and down the Widget Tree, and computing a bunch of stuff such as sizes of List contents,
  etc.&nbsp; In addition, layout also causes lots of stuff to be redrawn!</LI>
  </OL>

  <p>So it is clear that these two are to be avoided at all cost.&nbsp; Here's
  how FOX does this:</p>

  <OL>
  <LI>Expose or repaint events are stacked up until the system has processed
  all user input events.&nbsp; Moreover, exposed regions are compounded so
  that in most cases only one repaint is necessary.</LI>
  <BR>
  <LI>Layout is performed during the GUI Update phase; in other words, layout
  is delayed similarly to repainting so that only a single big layout remains
  to be done at the end [I believe FOX is unique in this; having scrutinized
  many systems, I have not found any that incorporate this feature; I think
  it is therefore safe to say that I invented this...].</LI>
  <BR>
  <LI>Size-caching is performed by certain [complex] Widgets to avoid potentially
  expensive size computations; for example, resizing a ScrollWindow does
  not necessarily change the size of the content.</LI>
  </OL>

  <p>So how well does this all work?&nbsp; <B><I>It Really Rocks</I></B>!&nbsp;
  The <B><I>delayed painting</I></B> is important, as it prevents stacking
  up huge piles of expose events when for example dragging [solid-, or opaque-dragging]
  windows over FOX applications.&nbsp; By NOT doing the unnecessary work,
  the system actually catches up more quickly, and never falls behind more
  than one repaint.</p>

  <p>The <B><I>delayed layout</I></B> is responsible for the extremely fast
  startup times of FOX applications.&nbsp; As hundreds of Widgets are being
  added during construction of an application's GUI, recalculating layout
  after each addition really kills startup performance.
  <BR>Delayed layout benefits performance each time many GUI Widgets are
  added or removed, or if layout hints are changed with widespread effects.&nbsp;
  It also makes opaque resizing [supported by a few X Window Managers] quite
  fast.</p>

  <p>Several advanced GUI systems have added special freeze/thaw semantics
  to temporarily suspend layout calculations.&nbsp; In FOX, this feature
  is automatic, and application-wide in effect.</p>

  <p>As the delayed layout is performed as part of the GUI Update process,
  GUI Update message handlers should avoid making changes to Controls that
  could cause layout computation, as these changes will not be handled till
  the next GUI Update cycle.

  <p>One more speed-feature related to use of Brian Paul's excellent Mesa
  graphics library.&nbsp; With Mesa, double buffering is implemented using
  a software backbuffer.&nbsp; Thus, after having drawn this back buffer,&nbsp;
  an expose event can repaint the dirty area simply by blitting back this
  back buffer, instead of re-rendering OpenGL commands [which can be very
  expensive indeed!].</p>

  <p>Hence, FOX distinguishes between ``synthetic'' repaint events and ``non-synthetic''
  ones.&nbsp; Synthetic expose events are those that originate from within
  the application.&nbsp; When receiving a synthetic expose event, the OpenGL
  will have to be regenerated; for non-synthetic expose events, the back
  buffer can be blitted back.</p>
