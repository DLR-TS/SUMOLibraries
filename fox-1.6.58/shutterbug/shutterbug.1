shutterbug \- screen snapshot application
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBshutterbug\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Shutterbug is a simple screen snapshot application inspired by SGI Snapshot.

The user interface of Shutterbug consists of a single, unobstrusive icon.
All functions in Shutterbug are invoked by right-clicking on this icon,
which will bring up a popup menu.  A red rectangle identifies the area
of the screen being captured.

.SH IDENTIFYING THE SCREEN AREA

The screen capture area is identified by a red rectangle.  The
capture area can be moved around by right-mouse dragging, or by
holding the shift- or control key during left-mouse dragging.
The size of the rectangle can be changed by dragging on one of the
four sides or on the corners.

The capture area can also be set to a predefined, fixed size.  In that
case the rectangle can not be resized, but only dragged to a specific
position.
